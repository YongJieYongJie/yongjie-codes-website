* General Review
- This book provides an excellent treatment of the Go programming language,
  covering not just the language specification (i.e., syntax), but also how and
  why certain Go is designed in a certain way (e.g., variable stack size to
  enable huge recursion).
- The examples provided in the book are generally sufficiently concise, and yet
  fully demonstrates the concept at hand without being just-a-toy-example.
* Specific Takeaways
** Introduction
- Some of the characteristics of Go include the following:
  - Go has a garbage collector.
  - Go comes with a package system.
  - Go has first-class functions.
  - Go has lexical scope (as opposed to dynamic scope, where changes to a
    variable from any scope will affect all other usage of that variable).
  - Go has a system call interface.
  - Go has immutable strings in which text is generally encoded in UTF-8.
  - Most of Go's built-in data types and most library data structures are
    crafted to work naturally without explicit initialization or implicit
    constructors, so relatively few memory allocations and memory writes are
    hidden in the code.
  - Go's aggregate types (structs and arrays) hold their elements directly,
    requiring less storage and fewer allocations and pointer indirection
    compared to languages that use indirect fields (e.g., Python).
  - Go has variable-size stacks.
  - Go has no class hierachies or any classes; complex object behaviors are
    created from simpler ones by composition and the relationship between
    concrete types and abstract types (interfaces) is implicit, so a concrete
    type may satisfy an interface that the type's designer was unaware of.
** Chapter 1 - Tutorial
- Go is a compiled language.
- A Go source file might be compiled and runned as follows: ~go run
  helloworld.go~.
  - ~go build helloworld.go~ is used to create a persistent binary file.
- Each Go source file begins with ~package nameOfPackage~ that states which
  package the file belongs to.
  - The package ~main~ is special, and defines a standalone executable
    program. Within the package ~main~, the /function/ ~main~ defines where
    execution of the program begins.
- Go program will not compile if there are unused imports.
- Go does not require semicolons at the ends of statements or declarations,
  except where two or more appear on the same line.
  - Where newlines are placed matters to proper parsing of Go code because
    newlines following certain tokens are converted into semicolons. E.g., the
    opening brace of the function must be on the same line as the end of the
    ~func~ declaraton.
- The ~gofmt~ tool is used to rewrite the code into standard formatting.
- The ~goimports~ tool manages the insertion and removal of import declarations
  as needed. (Available by executing ~go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports~.)
- ~os.Args~ is used to obtain commandline arguments.
  - ~os.Args[0]~ contains the name of the command itself.
- Comments begin with ~//~.
- When declaring consecutive variables of the same type, the type identifier may
  be placed after the last of the consecutive variables. E.g., instead of ~var a
  int, b int~, we can write ~var a, b int~.
- Go provides the usual arithmetic operators: ~+~, ~+=~, ~++~ (prefix only).
  - Note however that the ~++~ operator results in a statement and not an
    expression, as such, the following is illegal: ~a = b++~.
- The for loop is the only loop statement in Go.
  - One of the form is as follows:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      for initialization; condition; post {
          // zero or more statements
      }
    #+END_SRC
- The /initialization/ and /post/ may be omitted, and if both are omitted, then
  the semicolons may be omitted too, as follows:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    // a traditional "while" loop
    for condition {
        //
    }
  #+END_SRC
- The /condition/ may be omitted for a infinate loop.
- Another form of the for loop iterates over a range of value, for example:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    import (
        "fmt"
        "os"
    )

    func main() {
        s, sep := "", ""
        for _, arg := range os.Args[1:] {
            s+= sep + arg
            sep = " "
            fmt.Println(s)
        }
    }
  #+END_SRC
- A variable may be declared (and sometimes also initialized) in several ways:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    s := ""
    var s string
    var s = ""
    var s string = ""
  #+END_SRC
  - The first form, a short variable declaration, is the most compact, but it
    may be used only within a function, not for package-level variables.
  - The second form relies on default initialization to the zero value for
    strings, which is ~""~.
  - The third form is rarely used except when declaring multiple variables.
  - The fourth form is explicit about the variable's type, which is redundant
    when it is the same as that of the initial value but necessary in other
    cases where they are not of the same type.
  - Generally, use either of the first two forms, with explicit initialization
    to say that the initial value is important and implicit initialization to
    say that the initial value doesn't matter.
- Use ~strings.Join()~ to build concatenate a slice strings (as opposed to
  concatenating each pair repeatedly).
*** Finding Duplicate Lines
- To read lines from standard input, use the following:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    input := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
    for input.Scan() {
        line := input.Text()
        fmt.Println(line)
    }
  #+END_SRC
- A ~map~ holds a set of key/value pairs and provides constant-time operations
  to store, retrieve, or test for an item in the set.
  - The key may be any type whose values can be compared with ~==~.
  - The value may be of any type.
  - When accessing a key that doesn't yet exist on the ~map~, the zero value of
    the type of the value will be returned (e.g., ~0~ of any number type, and
    ~""~ for string).
  - A ~map~ instance is created by calling ~make()~ and passing in the type of
    the ~map~ (i.e., specifying the type of the key and value):
    ~make(map[string]int)~.
  - A ~map~ is a /reference/ to the data structure created by ~make()~. I.e.,
    when passed to a function, the function receives a copy of the /reference/
    and not a copy of the actual ~map~. As such, changes made within the
    function to the ~map~ will be visible outside.
- ~Printf()~ is used to print formatted output. Common formatting verbs are as
  follows:
| Verb             | Meaning                                                        |
|------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~%d~             | decimal integer                                                |
| ~%x~, ~%o~, ~%b~ | integer in hexadecimal, octal, binary                          |
| ~%f~, ~%g~, ~%e~ | floating-point number: 3.141593 3.141592652589793 3.141593e+00 |
| ~%t~             | boolean: ~true~ or ~false~                                     |
| ~%c~             | rune (Unicode code point)                                      |
| ~%s~             | string                                                         |
| ~%q~             | quoted string ~"abc"~ or run ~'c'~                             |
| ~%v~             | any value in a natural format                                  |
| ~%T~             | type of any value                                              |
| ~%%~             | literal percent sign (no operand)                              |
- ~os.Open()~ return two values: an open file (~*os.File~) and a value of the
  built-in ~error~ type.
- Functions and other package-level entities may be declared in any order.
- ~ioutil.ReadFile()~ may be used to read a ~[]byte~ directly from a file whose
  path is provided as the argument.
- ~fmt.Fprintf()~ is used to print to a specified stream.
- Under the covers, ~bufio.Scanner()~, ~ioutil.ReadFile()~ and
  ~ioutil.WriteFile()~ use the ~Read()~ and ~Write()~ methods of ~*os.File~, but
  it's rare that most programmers need to access those lower-level routines
  directly.
*** Animated GIFs
- A struct type is a group of values called /fields/, often of different types,
  that are collected together in a single object that can be treated as a unit.
  - The individual fields of a struct can be accessed using dot notation.
- /Composite literals/ refers to the compact notation for instantiating any of
  Go's composite type from a sequence of elemment values:
  - For slices, an example would be ~[]color.Color{color.White, color.Black}~
  - For struct, an example would be ~gif.GIF{LoopCount: 20}~
*** Fetching a URL
- ~http.Get()~ makes an HTTP request and, if there is no error, returns a struct
  and ~error~. The ~Body~ field of the struct contains the server response as a
  readable stream.
- ~ioutil.ReadAll()~ reads an entire stream.
*** Fetching URLs Concurrently
- A /goroutine/ is a concurrent function execution.
  - The function ~main~ runs in a goroutine and the ~go~ statement creates
    additional goroutines. E.g., ~go myFunc(myArgs)~
- A /channel/ is a communication mechanism that allows one goroutine to pass
  values of a specified type to another goroutine.
  - A channel may be created using ~make()~: e.g., ~ch := make(chan string)~
    creates a channel of ~string~.
  - Value may be sent on a channel: e.g., ~ch <- expression~
  - Value may be received from a channel: e.g., ~<- ch~
  - When one goroutine attempts a send or receive on a channel, it blocks until
    another goroutine attempts the corresponding receive or send operation.
*** A Web Server
- ~http.HandleFunc()~ is used to associate a handler ~func~ with a location
  (e.g., ~"/"~ for the usual index page).
  - The handler ~func~ takes an arguments a ~http.ResponseWriter~ and a
    ~*http.Request~. The former is an output stream where the response may be
    written to.
- ~http.ListenAndServe()~ is used to start listening and serving on the address
  and port specified in the argument.
  - ~http.ListenAndServe()~ will use the handlers associated earlier by calls to
    ~http.HandleFunc()~ automatically (i.e., from the client code, there is
    nothing linking the calls to ~http.HandleFunc()~ and the call to
    ~http.ListenAndServe()~).
    - YJ: It seems like the whole ~net/http~ package is used as an "object
      instance". What if we want to start two different servers in the same
      program?
- A mutex (from ~sync.Mutex~) is used to ensure exclusive excess to resources
  when necessary.
- ~req.ParseForm()~ is used to parse form data in a HTTP request.
  - In Go, it is conventional to combine the potentially error-returning
    function call and the corresponding error check: e.g.,
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      if err := req.ParseForm(); err != nil {
          log.Print(err)
      }
    #+END_SRC
  - One benefit of the above approach is that it reduces the scope of ~err~ to
    only within the ~if~ block (and ~else~ block, if any).
- ~ioutil.Discard~ may be used as an output stream if the stream data is not
  required anymore, but nonetheless the stream must be processed (e.g., to count
  the number of bytes).
  - YJ: This would be similar to piping to ~/dev/null~ on Linux.
*** Loose Ends
- Switch statement in Go looks like this:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    switch coinflip() {
    case "heads":
        heads++
    case "tails":
        tails++
    default:
        fmt.Println("landed on edge!")
    }
  #+END_SRC
  - Cases do not fall through, so there is no "break" statement. Though there is
    a ~fallthrough~ statement to explicitly fall through to the next
    case. Repeated ~fallthrough~ statements are required to emulate a
    traditional switch-case control flow in C.
  - Cases do not have to be ~int~ values.
  - A ~switch~ expression does not need to have an operand (~coinflip()~ in the
    example above), and can just list the cases, each of which is a boolean
    expression:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      func Signum(x int) int {
          switch {
          case x > 0:
              return +1
          default:
              return 0
          case x < 0:
              return -1
          }
      }
    #+END_SRC
  - The switch expression may include an optional simple statement to set a
    value before it is tested.
** Chapter 2 - Program Structure
- In Go, the first letter of a name determines the entity's visibiliity across
  package boundaries: if the name begins with an upper-case letter, it is
  exported.
  - Package names themselves are always in lower case.
- Go uses camel case: e.g., ~myFavoriteThings~
- Acronyms are either all upper-case or all lower-case: e.g., ~htmlEscape~,
  ~HTMLEscape~ or ~escapeHTML~, but not ~escapeHtml~.
- Every source file in Go begins wiht a ~package~ declaration, followed by any
  ~import~ declarations, and then a sequence of /package-level` declarations of
  types, variables, constants and functions.
*** 2.3 Variables
- Variables in Go may be declared and initialized using short variable
  declarations of the form: ~name := expression~, where the type of ~name~ is
  determined by the type of ~expression~.
  - Short variable declaration is only valid within functions, and not on the
    package-level.
  - Within functions, short variable declarations is generally preferred for its
    conciseness. A ~var~ declaration tends to be reserved for when (a) the
    variables need an explicit type that differs from that of the initializer
    expression, or (b) the variables will be assigned a value later and its
    initial value is unimportant.
- *A short variable declaration does not necessarily declare all the variables
  on its left-hand side*.
  - If some (but not all) of the variables on the left-hand side are already
    declared in the same lexical block, then the short variable acts like an
    assignment to those variables.
  - If all of the variables on the left-hand side are already declared in the
    same lexical block, then the code will not compile.
  - A short variable declaration acts like an assignement only to variables that
    were already declared in the same lexical block.
- Go supports pointers.
  - Pointer are variables whose value hold the address of another /variable/.
  - Not every value has an address, but every variable does.
    - YJ: Does the above imply the following: (a) a literal does not have an
      address; (b) the value returned from a function (or is the result of an
      expression) has no address until it is assigned to a variable?
  - The ~&x~ expression yields a pointer to ~x~. If ~x~ is of type ~int~, then
    the yielded pointer is of type ~*int~. The ~&~ is called the address-of
    operator.
  - The statement ~*x = "my literal"~ is used to update the variable pointed to
    by ~*x~ (equivalently, the variable whose address is stored as the value of
    ~*x~).
  - The zero value of a pointer of any type is ~nil~.
  - Pointers are comparable, and two pointers are equal if and only if they
    point to the same variable or both are ~nil~.
  - A function can return the address of a local variable, in which case, the
    variable will remain in existence as long as there is a pointer pointing to
    the variable.
  - *Using pointers to create aliases of variables is a double-edged sword*.
    - Everytime time we write something like ~*p = v~, we are creating ~*p~ as
      an alias of ~v~.
    - This allow us to access ~v~ without using its name.
    - However, the result is that in order to find all statement that access
      that variable, we have to know all its aliases.
    - Note: aliases are also created when we copy values of (a) reference types
      like slices, maps, and channels; (b) and structs, arrays, and interfaces
      that contain the reference types.
- The ~flag~ package is a useful tool to use command-line arguments to set the
  values of certain variables distributed throughout the program.
- The ~new~ function is another way to create a variable.
  - The expression ~new(T)~ creates an unnamed variable of type ~T~, initializes
    it to the zero value of ~T~, and returns its address, which is a value of
    type ~*T~.
- A compiler may choose to allocate local variables on the heap or on the stack,
  but this choice is not determined by whether ~var~ or ~new~ was used to
  declare the variable.
  - E.g., a compiler would need to allocate a local variable on the heap if the
    variable will be reachable after the function exits; on the other hand, if
    the local variable is no longer reachable after the function exits, the
    compiler may choose not to allocate it on the heap even if the ~new()~
    function is used.
*** 2.5 Type Declarations
- A type declaration defines a new /named/ type that has the same /underlying
  type/ as an existing type. The named type provdes a way to separate different
  and perhaps incompatible uses of the underlying type so that they can't by
  mixed unintentionally.
  - E.g., In a temperature conversion package, we might declare ~type Celsiues
    float64~ and ~type Fahrenheit float64~ so that we will not in advertently
    compare the two directly or use them together in arithmetic expressions.
  - In the above example, ~Celsius(37.3)~ would be a type conversion, and will
    not change the value or representation of the operand (in this case its
    ~37.3~, but it might be an other compatible type with the samae underlying
    type).
    - *Caveat*: Conversions between numeric types may change the representation
      of the value. E.g., converting a floating-point number to an integer
      discards any fractional part. Conversions between string and some slice
      types also results in implicit side effect. E.g., converting a string to a
      ~[]byte~ allocates a copy of the string data.
  - Conversion never fails at run time.
  - Operations supporting by the underlying type will be available to the new
    named type. E.g., the arithmetic operations will be available to the
    ~Celsius~ type declared in our example above.
  - Named types also allow us to define new behaviors for values of the type by
    defining methods.
*** 2.6 Packages and Files
- The source code for a package resides in one or more ~.go~ files, usually in a
  directory whose name ends with the import path.
- Each package serves as a separate name space for its declaration.
- Package-level names like the types and constants declared in one file of a
  package are visible to all the other files of the package.
- Each of the source files comprising a package may import only what is required
  within that single source file. E.g., there might be a source file containing
  the various output functions, and hence that particular source file will
  likely need to import ~fmt~; for the other source files, they may not need to
  import ~fmt~ if none of the functionality of ~fmt~ are required in them.
- Doc comment immediately preceding the package declaration documents the
  package as a whole.
  - Only one file in the package should have a package doc comment.
  - Extensive doc comments are often placed in a file of their own,
    conventionally called ~doc.go~.
- Imports are specified using strings like ~"gopl.io/ch2/tempconv"~; the
  language specification doesn't define where these strigs come from or what
  they mean.
- Note: the package name (i.e., the name that appears in the package declaration
  at the start of a Go source file) is the same as the last segment of its
  import path (i.e., the string used for specifying imports) purely by
  convention.
  - It is not necessarily the case that the two will match.
- Package are initialized by initializing package-level variables in the order
  in which they are declared, except that dependencies are resolved first.
  - If the package has multiple ~.go~ files, thy are initialized in the order in
    which the files are given to the compiler; though the ~go~ tool sorts ~.go~
    files by name before invoking the compiler.
- The ~init()~ function may also be used to initialization: they are
  automatically executed when the program starts, in the order in which they are
  declared.
  - Such ~init()~ functions may not be called or referenced.
  - There may be any number of such ~init()~ functions within a file.
- One package is initialized at a time, in the order of the imports in the
  program, dependencies first.
  - I.e., a package ~p~ importing ~q~ can be sure that ~q~ is fully initialized
  program, dependencies firstbefore ~p~'s initialization begins.
*** 2.7 Scope
- The example code below demonstrates three different variables called ~x~
  program, dependencies firstdeclared in a different lexical block:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    func main() {
        x := "hello!"
        for i := 0; i < len(x); i++ {
            x := x[i]
            if x != '!' {
                x := x + 'A' - 'a'
                fmt.Printf("%c", x) // "HELLO" (one letter per iteration)
            }
        }
    }
  #+END_SRC
- The example code below also has three variables named ~x~, each declared in a
  different block---one in the function body, one in teh ~for~ statement`s
  block, and one in the loop body---but only two of the blocks are explicit:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    func main() {
        x := "hello"
        for _, x := range x {
            x := x + 'A' - 'a'
            fmt.Printf("%c", x) // "HELLO" (one letter per iteration)
        }
    }
  #+END_SRC
- ~if~ statements and ~switch~ statements also create implicit blocks in
  addition to their body blocks:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    if x := f(); x == 0 {
        fmt.Println(x)
    } else if y := g(x); x == y {
        fmt.Println(x, y)
    } else {
        fmt.Println(x, y)
    }
    fmt.Println(x, y) // compile error: x and y are not visible here
  #+END_SRC
- When using a function that returns two variables, one for the actual variable
  we are interested in, and one for the error, it is conventional to handle the
  error in the ~if~ block, and proceed with the "happy" path after the ~if~
  block, without using an ~else~ block (so that it is not indented):
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    f, err := os.Open(fname)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    f.ReadByte()
    f.Close()
  #+END_SRC
  - I.e., the following is not preferred:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      if f, err := os.Open(fname); err != nil {
          return err
      } else {
          // f and err are visible here too
          f.ReadByte()
          f.Close()
      }
    #+END_SRC
- Take special care when assigning to variables from an outer scope. Usage of
  ~:=~ short variable declaration will instead result in an declaration of a new
  variable in the inner scope that'll shadow the variable in the outer scope.
  - The issue may be avoided by using the simple assignment operation ~=~
    instead.
  - E.g., assuming we intend to assign to a ~cwd~ variable from the outer scope,
    instead of ~cwd, err := os.Getwd()~ (which will result in declaration of a
    new ~cwd~ in the local scope, use ~cwd, err = os.GetWd()~. In the latter,
    ~err~ will need to be declared prior using ~var err error~.
** Chapter 3 - Basic Data Types
- Go's types fall into four categories:
  - *Basic types*: e.g., numbers, strings and booleans
  - *Aggregate types*: e.g., arrays and structs
  - *Reference types*: e.g., pointers, slices, maps, functions and channels
  - *Interface types*
*** 3.1 Integers
- The types ~int~ and ~unit~ are signed and unsigned integers that are the
  natural or most efficient size on a particular platform.
  - Their size may be 32 or 64 bits, but *one must not make assumption about
    which* as different compilers may make different choices even on identical
    hardware.
- The type ~rune~ is an synonym for ~int32~ and conventionally indicates that a
  value is a Unicode code point.
- The unsigned type ~uintptr~ has unspecified width but is sufficient to hold
  all the bits of a pointer value. It is used only for low-level programming,
  such as at the boundary of a Go program with a C library or an operating
  system.
- Go integer types will overflow and underflow (e.g., according to the
  underlying two's complement representation for signed integers).
- Go code tend to use the signed ~int~ even for quantities that can't be
  negative, such the the length of an array, though ~uint~ might seem a more
  obvious choice.
  - The built-in ~len()~ function returns an ~int~.
  - Using signed ~int~ allows proper functioning of loops that decrement the
    loop variable, and terminating when the variable is smaller than zero.
    - If the unsigned ~unit~ were used instead, it would have underflowed to the
      maximum integer value of its type, and the loop will never end.
  - *Unsigned numbers tend to be used only when their bitwise operators or
    peculiar arithmetic operators are required*, as when implementing bit sets,
    parsing binary file formats, or for hashing and cryptography.
- Avoid conversion in which the operand is out of range for the target type, e.g.:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    f := 1.100 // a float64 with very big value
    i := int(f) // result is implementation-dependent
  #+END_SRC
- Some examples of printing numbers in various formats are as below:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    o := 0666 // octal literal
    fmt.Printf("%d %[1]o %#[1]o\n", o) // "438 666 0666"
    x := int64(0xdeadbeef)
    fmt.Printf("%d %[1]x %#[1]x %x[1]X\n", x)
    // Output:
    // 3735928559 deadbeef 0xdeafbeef 0XDEADBEEF
  #+END_SRC
*** 3.2 Floating-Point Numbers
- The function ~math.IsNaN()~ tests whether its argument is a not-a-number
  value.
- It is tempting to use ~NaN~ as a sentinel value in a numeric
  computation. However, testing for ~NaN~ is fraught with perils because any
  comparison (e.g., ~==~, ~<~, ~>~) with ~NaN~ is always false.
  - If a function that returns a floating-point result might fail, a better
    approach is to report the failure separately, for example:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      func compute() (value float64, ok bool) {
          // ...
          if failed {
              return 0, false
          }
          return result, true
      }
    #+END_SRC
*** 3.5 Strings
- A string is an immutable sequence of bytes.
  - *The /i/-th byte of a string is not necessarily the /i/-th /character/ of
    the string*, because UTF-8 encoding of a non-ASCII code point requires two
    or more bytes
- A raw string literal is written using `...`, using backquotes instead of
  double quotes. Within a raw string, no escape sequencies are processed. The
  only processing is that carriage returns are deleted so that the value of the
  string is the same on all platforms.
- *Go's ~range~ loop, when applied to a string, performs UTF-8 decoding
  implicitly*.
- A ~[]rune~ conversion applied to a UTF-8-encoded string returns the sequence
  of Unicode code points that the string encodes.
- Converting an integer value to a string interprets the integer as a rune
  value, and yields the UTF-8 representation of that rune:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    fmt.Println(string(65)) // "A", not "65"
    fmt.Println(string(0x4eac)) // "京"
  #+END_SRC
  - If the rune is invalid, the replacement character is substituted:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      fmt.Println(string(1234567)) // "�"
    #+END_SRC
- A UTF-8 encoded string can be converted to runes using the following:
  ~[]rune(theString)~.
- The ~path~ and ~path/filepath~ packages provides general set of functions for
  working with hierarchical names. The former is appropriate for any
  slash-delimited paths (e.g., URLs) but should not be used for manipulating
  file names. The latter should be used for file names.
- The ~bytes~ and ~strings~ packages have numerous parallel functions to avoid
  the need to convert from string to slice of bytes and back (and /vice versa/).
  - This is because conversion and string to slice of bytes (and /vice versa/)
    requires copying to maintain immutability of the string.
- The ~bytes.Buffer~ type is extremely versatile, and may be used as a
  replacement for a file whenever an I/O function requires a sink for bytes
  (~io.Writer~) or a source of bytes (~io.Reader~).
- Conversions between strings and numbers are done with functions from the
  ~strconv~ package.
*** 3.6 Constants
- Many computations on constants can be completely evaluated at compile time.
- The results of all arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations applied to
  constant operands are themselves constants.
  - This is also the case for the results of conversions and calls to certain
    built-in functions such as ~len~, ~cap~, ~real~, ~imag~, ~complex~, and
    ~unsafe.Sizeof~.
- A constant declaration /may/ specify a type as well as a value.
  - In the absence of an explicit type, the type is inferred from the expression
    on the right-hand side.
- A ~const~ declaration may use the /constant generator/ ~iota~, which is used to
  create a sequence of related value without spelling out each one.
  - In a ~const~ declaration, the value of ~iota~ begins at zero and increments
    by one for each item in the sequence.
  - YJ: Think of the word "iota" as the long form of ~i~, the defacto loop
    variable. iota is also the first letter in the greek alphabet.
  - An example usage of iota would be in a ~const~ declaration of flags:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      type Flags uint
    
      const (
          FlagUp Flags = 1 << iota  // 0b00001
          FlagBroadcast             // 0b00010
          FlagLoopback              // 0b00100
          FlagPointToPoint          // 0b01000
          FlagMulticast             // 0b10000
      )
    #+END_SRC
  - ~iota~ can be used in similar ways to create a simple enum of consecutive
    integers, or a ~const~ declaration of powers of 2 (or powers or any power of
    2).
- Constant may have uncommitted types.
  - The compiler represents these uncommitted constants wiht much greater
    numeric precision than values of basic types, and arithmetic on them is more
    precise than machine arithmetic. It is generally safe to assume at least 256
    bits of precision.
  - There are six flavors of uncommited constants: untyped boolean, untyped
    integer, untyped rune, untype floating-point, untyped complex and untyped
    string.
    - YJ: Untyped constants are necessary for certain fundamental features of
      the language to work. E.g.:
      #+BEGIN_SRC go
        type OnOff bool
      
        var t = true     // variable of type bool
        const f = false  // constant of untyped bool
      
        var myState OnOff // variable of type OnOff
      
        myState = t // compile error because assigning t of type bool to myState
                    //   of type OnOff
      
        myState = f // OK
      #+END_SRC
    - YJ: Essentially what uncommitted constants give Go programmers is the
      ability to use constants as if the each usage of the constant is replaced
      with the literal used to declare the constant in the first place.
  - Note: untype integers are converted to ~int~, whose size is not guaranteed,
    but untyped floating-point and complex numbers are converted to the
    explicitly sized types ~float64~ and ~complex128~.
    - This is because the language has no unsized ~float~ and ~complex~ types
      analogous to unsized ~int~. This is further because it is very difficult
      to write correct numerical algorithms without knowing the size of one's
      floating-point data types.
** Chapter 4 - Composite Type
- Arrays and structs are /aggregate/ types: their values are concatenations of
  other values in memory.
  - Both arrays and struct are fixed size. In contrast, slices and maps are
    dynamic data structures that grow as values are added.
*** 4.1 Arrays
- Declaration:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    var a [6]rune // array of 6 runes
  #+END_SRC
- Literal initialization:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    var a [2]string = [2]string{"one", "two"} // array of 2 strings
    b := [...]string{"one", "two"}            // same as above
    c := [...]int{99: -1} // array of 100 elements, all zeroes except the last,
                          //   which has the value of -1
  #+END_SRC
- The size of an array is part of its type: so ~[2]byte~ and ~[3]byte~ are
  different types.
- Arrays are comparable if the underlying type is comparable.
- *Arrays are passed by value by default*.
*** 4.2 Slices
- Declaration:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    var a = []int
  #+END_SRC
- A slice has three components: a pointer, a length, and a capacity.
  - The pointer points to the first element of the array that is reachable
    through the slice, which is not necessarily the array's first element.
  - The length is the number of slice elements; it can't exceed the capacity,
    which is usually the number of elements between the start of the slice and
    the end of the underlying array.
- The slice operator (e.g., ~s[i:j]~) is used to create a new slice that refers
  to elements ~i~ through ~j-1~ of the sequence ~s~, which may be an array
  variable, a pointer to an array, or another slice.
  - Slicing beyond ~cap(s)~ causes a panic, but slicing beyond ~len(s)~ extends
    the slice.
- YJ: Would the capacity of a slice pointing to a slice increase if the lengthof
  the pointed-to slice increases?
- *Slices are not comparable using ~==~*.
  - The standard libary does provide a highly optimized ~bytes.Equal()~ to
    compare two slices of bytes.
  - For other types of slices, we'll need to do the comparison ourselves:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      func equal(x, y []string) bool {
          if len(x) != len(y) {
              return false
          }
          for i := range x {
              x[i] != y[i] {
                  return false
              }
          }
          return true
      }
    #+END_SRC
  - The reason why the comparison in the code fragement above is not implemented
    as the default comparison for slices is because elements of slices are
    indirect and a slice may contain itself, and there is no obvious way to do
    comparison in such instances.
  - A that a default comparison of slices is not implemented is because a hash
    table such as Go's map type only makes shallow copies of its key, and it
    requires that equality for each key remain the same throughout the lifetime
    of the hash table. However, the underlying elements of a slice might change.
  - YJ: From brief Googl-ing it seems like slice comparison is not implemented
    by default because there are at least two notions of equality for slices,
    the and langauge itself is not choosing which notion is the default. The two
    notions are: (1) the slices must be of same length and point to the same
    underlying sequence at the same index, (2) the values of each element of the
    slice must be the same.
- To test whether a slice is empty, use ~len(s) == 0~.
  - Don't ~s == nil~, which compares true only for a slice having its zero value
    (which is ~nil~).
- Slice can be created using the built-in ~make()~ function: ~make([]T, len)~ or
  ~make([]T, len, cap)~.
- The built-in ~append()~ function is used to append items to slices:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    s = []int{1, 2, 3}
    s = append(s, 4) // s = [1 2 3 4]
  #+END_SRC
  - Notice that the result of ~append()~ is assigned back to ~s~. This is
    because the underlying array of ~s~ might not be modified in place. Instead
    a new underlying array may be created (e.g., when resizing to accomodate the
    new element), and a different slice will be returned by ~append()~. Hence
    the need for re-assignment.
    - Generally, such re-assignment is required when calling any function that
      may change the length or capacity of the slice, or make it refer to a
      different underlying array.
*** 4.3 Maps
- Map type in Go is written ~map[K]V~, where ~K~ and ~V~ are the types of its
  keys and values. The keys must be comparable using ~==~.
- Empty maps can be created using the built-in ~make()~ function or empty literal:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    myMap := make(map[myKeyType]myValueType)
    myMap := map[myKeyType]myValueType{}
  #+END_SRC
- A map literal can be created as follows:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    ages := map[string]int{
        "alice":   31,
        "charlie": 34,
    }
  #+END_SRC
- Elements can be deleted using the built-in ~delete()~ function: e.g.,
  ~delete(ages, "alice")~.
- Elements may be assessed even if it is not in the map---the operation will
  simply return the zero value of that type.
  - To check whether an element exists, use the second return value of the
    lookup operation; e.g.: ~age, ok := ages["bob"]~
- Elements themselves are not variables, and so we cannot take their address:
  e.g., ~&ages["bob"]~ is illegal.
- Most operations on maps, including lookup, ~delete()~, ~len()~ and ~range~
  loops, are safe to perform on a ~nil~ map reference.
  - But storing to a ~nil~ map causes a panic.
- Go does not provide a set type. Maps will ~bool~ values are generally used.
*** 4.4 Structs
- A struct type declaration and its variable declaration may look something like
  this:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    type Employee struct {
        ID int
        Name string
        Address string
        DoB time.Time
        Position string
        Salary int
        ManagerID int
    }

    var dilbert Employee
  #+END_SRC
- Fields of the struct are themselves variables, and address of them may be
  taken using the ~&~ operator.
- Fields of the struct are may be accessed via the dot operator: e.g.,
  ~dilbert.Position~.
  - The dot operator works the same way for pointers to the struct:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      var employeeOfTheMonth *Employee = &dilbert
      employeeOfTheMonth.Position += " (proactive team player)"
      (*employeeOfTheMonth).Position += " (proactive team player)"
    #+END_SRC
  - The last two lines in the code fragment above are equivalent.
- A struct field is exported if its name begins with a capital letter.
- A named struct type ~S~ cannot declare a field that contains itself.
  - It may however declare a pointer type ~*S~.
- The zero value for a struct is compased of the zero values of each of its
  fields.
- The struct type with no fields is called the /empty struct/, written
  ~struct{}~.
  - It has size zero and carries no information but may be useful nonetheless.
- Struct literal may be written by specifying the values of the fields in order,
  for example:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    type Point struct{ X, Y int }
    p := Point{1, 2}
  #+END_SRC
  - Note that the above form requires users to memorize the order of the fields,
    and are also fragile to code changes when fields are added / reordered; as
    such, it is generally used for struct where the fields have an obvious
    ordering convention.
  - A second form of writing struct literal is by using the field names:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      anim := gif.GIF{LoopCount: nframes}
    #+END_SRC
  - The two forms cannot be mixed.
- Struct are passed by value.
  - As such, it may be more efficient to pass pointers to struct.
  - Struct pointers are so commonly dealt with that there is shorthand notation
    to create and initialize and struct variable and obtain its address:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      pp := &Point{1, 2}
    
      // exactly equivalent to:
      pp := new(Point)
      *pp = Point{1, 2}
    #+END_SRC
  - The shorthand notation may be used directly within an expression, such as a
    function call.
- If all the fields of a struct are comparable, the struct itself is comparable.
- *struct embedding*
  - The struct embedding mechanism let us use one named struct type as an
    anonymous field of another struct type, providing a convenient syntactic
    shortcut so that a simple dot expression like ~x.f~ can stand for a chain of
    fields like ~x.d.e.f~.
  - Without struct embedding, we might do the following:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      type Point struct {
          X, Y int
      }
    
      type Circle struct {
          Center Point
          Radius int
      }
    
      type Wheel struct {
          Circle Circle
          Spokes int
      }
    
      var w Wheel
      w.Circle.Center.X = 8 // Cumbersome field access
      w.Circle.Center.Y = 8
      W.Circle.Radius = 5
      W.Spokes = 20
    #+END_SRC
  - With struct embedding, we can do the following:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      type Circle struct {
          Point
          Radius int
      }
      
      type Wheel struct {
          Circle
          Spokes int
      }
    
      var w Wheel
      w.X = 8 // equivalent to w.Circle.Point.X = 8
      w.Y = 8 // equivalent to w.Circle.Point.Y = 8
      w.Radius = 5 // equivalent to w.Circle.Radius = 5
      w.Spokes = 20
    #+END_SRC
  - There is however no struct embedding for literal struct syntax.
  - Because the "anonymous" fields do have implicit names, we can't have two
    anonymous fields of the same type as their names would conflict.
    - Because the name of the "anonymous" field is implicity determined by its
      type, so too is the visibility of the field. E.g.:
      #+BEGIN_SRC go
      type circle {...}
      type point {...}
      type Wheel {
          circle, point
      }
      
      var w Wheel
      w.X = 8 // Ok, equivalent to w.circle.point.X = 8
      w.circle.point.X = 8 // Compile error: circle not visible
      #+END_SRC
  - struct embedding also works for fields of any named type or pointer to a
    named type. This allow the struct to "inherit" methods defined for the named
    type.
- To print a value in a form similar to Go syntax, use ~%#v~ in the formatting
  string. E.g., ~fmt.Printf("%#v\n", myVar)~
*** 4.5 JSON
- Field tags are strings of metadata associated at compile time with the fields
  of a struct.
  - An example of field tags usage is in JSON marshaling as follows: 
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
    type Movie struct {
        Title string
        Year int `json:"released"`
        Color bool `json:"color,omitempty"`
        Actors []string
    }
    
    var movies = []Movie{
        {Title: "Casablanca", Year: 1942, Color: false,
            Actors: []string{"Humphrey Bogart", "Ingrid Bergman"}},
        //...
    }
  
    data, err := json.Marshal(movies)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("JSON marshaling failed: %s", err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("%s\n", data) // Prints the JSON-formatted movies
    #+END_SRC
  - A field tag may be any literal string, but is conventionally interpreted as
    a space-separated list of ~key:"value"~ pairs, surrounded by backticks
    because the use of double quotation marks.
*** 4.6 Text and HTML Templates
- Go has a built-in templating language used in the standard libraries
  ~text/template~ and ~html/template~.
  - A simple template string is as follows:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      // Simple template string for formatting Git issues
      const templ = `{{.TotalCount}} issues:
      {{range .Items}}----------------------
      Number: {{.Number}}
      User:   {{.User.Login}}
      Title:  {{.Title | printf "%.64s"}}
      Age:    {{.CreatedAt | daysAgo}} days
      {{end}}`
    #+END_SRC
** Chapter 5 - Functions
*** 5.1 Function Declarations
- A function declaration looks as follows:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    func name(parameter-list) (result-list) {
        body
    }
  #+END_SRC
- Go has no concept of default parameter values, nor any way to specify
  arguments by name.
- Arguments are passed by value.
*** 5.2 Recursion
- Typical Go implementations use variable-size stacks that start small and grow
  as needed up to a limit on the order of a gigabyte.
  - As such, recursion may be used safely without worrying about overflow.
- An interesting use of slice in relation to recursive function calls is to use
  the slice a sort of stack which keeps track of the position in the iteration.
  - /Pushing to stack/: Each iteration of the recursive function will append an
    item to the slice before calling itself, passing in the new slice.
  - /Popping from stack/: The subtle aspect is that there is no need for a
    corresponding call to "pop" items from the slice.
    - This is because even though each recursive call deeper down will add an
      element to the stack (modifying the underlying array and perhaps even
      allocating a new array), when the recursive call returns, the calling
      function still has reference to the slice before just before the recursive
      call was called.
*** 5.3 Multiple Return Values
- Go functions can return multiple values (referred to as "results" in the
  book).
- A multi-valued call may appear as the sole argument when calling a function of
  multiple parameters.
- The results may be named in the function declaration itself, improving
  readability.
  - In a function with named results, the operands in a ~return~ statement might
    be omitted.
  - This is called a bare return---each of the named result variables are
    returned in order.
  - E.g.:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      func CountWordsAndImages(url string) (words, images int, err error) {
          resp, err := http.Get(url)
          if err != nil {
              return
          }
          doc, err := html.Parse(resp.Body)
          resp.Body.Close()
          if err != nil {
              err = fmt.Errorf("parsing HTML: %s", err)
              return
          }
          words, images = countWordsAndImages(doc)
          return
      }
      func countWordsAndImages(n \*html.Node) (words, images int) { \/\* ... \*/ }
    #+END_SRC
*** 5.4 Errors
- A function for which failure is an expected behavior returns an additional
  result, conventionally the last one.
  - If the failure has only one possibly cause, the result is a ~boolean~,
    usually called ~ok~. E.g., lookup on a ~map~.
  - If the failure may have a variety of causes for which the caller will need
    an explanation, the result is of type ~error~.
    - The built-in ~error~ is an interface type.
    - A nil error implies success while a non-nil error implies failure.
    - The error message string of a non-nil error can be obtained by calling its
      ~Error()~ method or printed by calling ~fmt.Println(err)~ or
      ~fmt.Printf("%v", err)~.
- Unlike many other languages which use exceptions to report errors, Go uses
  ordinary values.
  - The reason is to decouple description of an error with the control flow
    required to handle it.
  - In languages were exceptions are used, the entanglement of the description
    of an error with the control flow required to handle often results in
    routine errors reported to the end user in the form of an incomprehensible
    stack trace.
  - Go's approach of using ordinary return values and ordinary control-flow
    mechanisms like ~if~ and ~return~ intentionally requires more attention to
    be paid to the error-handling logic.
**** 5.4.1 Error-Handling Strategies
- *Propagate*
  - This is were a subroutine's error becomes a failure of the calling routine.
  - The error from the subroutine may be returned directly, or may be enriched
    with information only available in the error-handling function.
  - Because error messages are freuently chained together, they should not be
    capitalized and newlines should be omitted.
    - This results in long error strings on a single line, which will be
      self-contained when picked up by tools like ~grep~.
    - YJ: It seems that generally error messages should be phrased either of two
      ways, depending on whether it is the cause, or it is merely propating
      another error.
      - E.g., consider two functions: ~parseHtml()~ which calls
        ~tokeniseHtml()~.
        - If ~tokenisedHtml()~ fails because of illegal character in the tag, it
          may return an error with message like ~fmt.Errorf("illegal character
          in tag: %s", tagWithIllegalChar)~.
        - When ~parseHtml()~ receives this error, it might propagate the error
          by adding the name the HTML file like ~fmt.Error("parsing file %s:
          %v", fileName, tokeniseErr)~.
        - The resultant error message will be something like: ~parsing file
          myFile.html: illegal character in tag: <body<~. Notice how this error
          string reads smoothly if we add the word "error" at the beginning.
- *Retry*
  - An example of retry might look something as follows:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      // WaitForServer attempts to contact the server of a URL.
      // It tries for one minute using exponential back-off.  It reports an
      // error if all attempts fail.
      func WaitForServer(url string) error {
          const timeout = 1 * time.Minute
          deadline := time.Now().Add(timeout)
          for tries := 0; time.Now().Before(deadline); tries++ {
              _, err := http.Head(url)
              if err == nil {
                  return nil // success
              }
              log.Printf("server not responding (%s); retrying...", err)
              time.Sleep(time.Second << uint(tries)) // exponential back-off
          }
          return fmt.Errorf("server %s failed to respond after %s", url, timeout)
      }
    #+END_SRC
- *Print Error and Stop Program*
  - If progress is not possible, the caller can print the error and stop the
    program gracefully.
    - This should generally be reserved for the main package of a program.
    - Library functions should usually propagate errors to the caller, unless
      the error is sign of an internal inconsistency---that is, a bug.
  - Error messages may be printed using ~fmt.Printf()~, and followed by a call
    to ~os.Exit(1)~.
    - Alternatively, ~log.Fatalf()~ may be used to print and exit. As with other
      ~log~ functions, it prefixes the time and date by default (this may be
      changed using ~log.SetPrefix()~).
- *Log Error and Continue*
  - Again, there's a choice between using the ~log~ package, which adds the
    usual prefix:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      if err := Ping(); err != nil {
          log.Printf("ping failed: %v; networking disabled", err)
      }
    #+END_SRC
    and printing directly to the standard error stream:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      if err := Ping(); err != nil {
          fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "ping failed: %v; networking disabled\n", err)
      }
    #+END_SRC
    - Note that all ~log~ functions append a newline if one is not already
      present.
- *Ignore*
- Author's comment on error handling in Go:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Error handling in Go has a particular rhythm. After checking an error, failure
is usually dealt with before success. If failure causes the function to return,
the logic for success is not indented within an ~else~ block but follows at the
outer level. Functions tend to exhibit a common structure, with a series of
initial checks to reject errors, followed by the substance of the function at
the end, minimally indented.
#+END_QUOTE
**** 5.4.2 End of File (EOF)
- In certain situations, the program logic might be different depending on the
  error return (as opposed to the mere fact that there has been an error).
  - An example is when a call to read /n/ bytes fail because end of file has
    been reached.
  - In such a situation, a distinguished ~error~ (YJ: like a singleton ~error~)
    is returned for the caller to performed comparison against the distinguished
    ~error~ exported by the package.
  - E.g., the ~io~ package exports and also returns ~io.EOF~.
    - ~EOF~ is declared in the ~io~ package as follows: ~var EOF =
      errors.New("EOF")~.
*** 5.5 Function Values
- Functions are first-class values in Go---like other values, function values
  have types, and they may be assigned to variables or passed to or returned
  from functions. A function value may be called like any other function.
  - The zero value of a function type is ~nil~.
  - Calling a ~nil~ function value causes a panic.
- Function values let us parameterize our functions over not just data, but
  behavior too.
  - Examples of such usage within the standard library include: ~strings.Map~
    which applies a function to each character of a string.
- A way to print indented output is the following: ~fmt.Printf("%*s<%s>\n",
  indentationLevel, "", actualContent)~.
  - The ~%*s~ verb specifies a variable-width string, and the width ~*~ will be
    taken from the next operand, which is the case of the example above, is
    ~indentationLevel~. The next operand is an empty string.
*** 5.6 Anonymous Functions
- Named functions can be declared only at the package level. But a function
  literal may be use to denote function value within any expression.
  - A function literal is written like a function declaration, but without a
    name following the ~func~ keyword.
  - Function literals form closures around the surronding lexical environment.
  - YJ: Question: Python need a local keyword to allow
- Because of lexical scoping rules, iteration variables need to be captured if
  its value will be used after the iteration has ended.
  - In particular, iteration in Go creates two lexical scope: (1) the implicit
    outer scope containing the iteration variable and other simple
    initializations, and (2) one explicit inner scope within the curly braces.
  - While there is a separate inner scope for each iteration, the implicit outer
    scope is shared by all iterations.
  - An example of capturing of iteration variable is as follows:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      var rmdirs []func()
      for _, d := range tempDirs() {
          dir := d // captured
          os.MkdirAll(dir, 0755)
          rmdirs = append(rmdirs, func() {
              os.RemoveAll(dir) // using dir instead of d, which would have 
                                // changed by the time thie anonymous function
                                // is actually called.
          })
      }
      // ... more processing ...
      for _, rmdir := range rmdirs {
          rmdir() // use the dir variable that is captured
    }
    #+END_SRC
*** 5.7 Variadic Functions
- A variadic function may be declared as follows:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    func sum(vals ...int) int {
        total := 0
        for _, val := range vals {
            total += val
        }
        return total
    }
  #+END_SRC
- Implicitly, the caller allocates an array, copies the arguments into it, and
  passes a slice of the entire array to the function.
*** 5.8 Deferred Function Calls
- The ~defer~ keyword is used to specify a function to be called when the
  current function containing the ~defer~ keyword finishes, whether normally or
  by panicking.
  - Syntactically, a ~defer~ statement is an ordinary function or method call
    prefix by the keyword ~defer~.
  - The function and argument expressions are evaluated when the ~defer~
    statement is executed, but the actual called is deferred until the function
    that contains the statement has finished.
  - Any number of calls may be deferred, and they are executed in the reverse of
    the order in which they were deferred.
- The ~defer~ statement is usually used to ensure resources are released, by
  having a ~defer~ statement immediately after where the resource is acquired.
  - The ~defer~ statement is also used for other paired operations like on-entry
    and on-exit actions.
  - YJ: ~defer~ statement seem to be Go's answer to resource managers like
    ~with~ in Python, ~try~ in Java, and ~using~ in C#.
- Defered functions run /after/ return statementsn have updated the function's
  result variables.
  - Because an anonymous function can access its enclosing function's variables,
    including named results, a deferred anonymous function can observe the
    function's results. E.g.:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      func double(x int) (result int) {
          defer func() { fmt.Printf("double(%d) = %d\n", x, result) }()
          return x + x
      }

      _ = double(4)
      // Output:
      // "double(4) = 8"
    #+END_SRC
  - A deferred anonymous function can also change the values that the enclosing
    function returns.
- Certain functions that seems to acquire resources may not actually acquire
  the resource on failure, and hence there is no need to use a defer statement
  to release the resource.
  - E.g., ~os.Create()~ is used to open a file of writing, creating it as
    needed. If there is an error, the calling function should return the error,
    instead of making a deferred call to close the returned ~*File~ variable
    which would be invalid.
*** 5.9 Panic
- During a typical panic, normal execution stops, all deferred function calls in
  that goroutine are executed, and the program crashes with a log message.
- Panics might come from the runtime, when performing certain checks only
  possible as runtime: e.g., deferencing a ~nil~ pointer, out-of-bounds array
  access.
- Panics might come from the built-in ~panic~ function.
  - Example of an appropriate situation to use ~panic~ would be whene some
    "impossible" situation happens, like when execution reaches a case that
    logically shouldn't happen.
- While it's good practice to assert that the preconditions of a function hold,
  this can easily be done to excess.
  - Unless you can provide a more informative error message or detect an error
    sooner, there is no point in asserting a condition that the runtime will
    check for you.
- Go's panic mechanism should be reserved for grave errors, such as a logical
  inconsistency in the program.
  - It should no be used as liberally as the exceptions handling mechanisms in
    some other languages.
  - In a robust program, "expected" errors, the kind that arise from incorrect
    input, misconfiguration, or failing I/O, should be handled gracefully; they
    are best dealt with using ~error~ values.
  - A result of this design is that for certain kinds of functions, they may
    return an non-~nil~ error value during normal program execution, but at some
    other times (e.g., at program initialization), the programmer knows that
    there should not be an error, and needs to convert that error into a panic.
    - This can get tedious. As such, it is common practice to define another
      helper function to do the error checking and converting to panic.
    - E.g.:
      #+BEGIN_SRC go
        package regexp

        func Compile(expr string) (*Regexp, error) { /* ... */ }

        func MustCompile(expr string) *Regexp {
            re, err := Compile(expr)
            if err != nil {
                panic(err)
            }
            return re
        }
      #+END_SRC
      The ~MustCompile()~ helper function makes it convenient for clients to
      initialize a package-level variable with a compiled regular expression:
      #+BEGIN_SRC go
        var httpSchemeRE = regexp.MustCompile(`^https?:`)
      #+END_SRC
*** 5.10 Recover
- General description of the panic mechanism in relation to the built-in
  ~recover~ function:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  If the built-in ~recover~ function is called within a deferred function and the
  function containing the ~defer~ statement is panicking, ~recover~ ends the
  current state of panic and returns the panic value. The function that was
  panicking does not contiue where it left off but returns normally. If ~recover~
  is called at any other time, it has no effect and returns ~nil~.
  #+END_QUOTE
- Example:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    func Parse(input string) (s *Syntax, err error) {
        defer func() {
            if p := recover(); p != nil {
                err = fmt.Errorf("internal error: %v", p)
            }
        }()
        // ...parser...
    }
  #+END_SRC
- As a general rule, you should not attempt to recover from another package's
  panic.
  - Public APIs should report failure as ~errors~.
- You should not recover from a panic that may pass through a function you do
  not maintain, such as a caller-provided callback, since you cannot reason
  about its safety.
  - E.g., the ~net/httep~ package provides a web server that dispatches incoming
    requests to user-provided handler functions. Rather than let a panic in one
    of these handlers kiil the process, the server calls ~recover~, prints a
    stack trace, and continue serving. This is convenient in practice, but it
    does risk leaking resources or leaving the failed handler in an unspecified
    state that could lead to other problems.
- One way to recover from an "expected" panic is to declare a special type
  (e.g., ~type myExpectedPanic struct{}~, and call ~panic(myExpectedPanic{})~
  when the expected situation occurs.
  - The deferred recover function might then ~switch~ on the value received from
    ~recover()~, and provide a case for ~bailout{}~ to handle to expected panic
    situation by converting the panic to an ~error~.
  - The deferred recover function should also provide a ~default~ case to the
    ~switch~ statement that simply calls ~panic()~ with the value received from
    ~recover()~ to resume the panic.
** Chapter 6 - Methods
*** 6.1 Method Declarations
- A method declaration is similar to a function declaration, but with an extra
  parameter (called the /receiver/) before the function name. This paramater
  attaches the function to the type of the parameter.
  - E.g.:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      import "math"
    
      type Point struct { X, Y float64 }
    
      func (p Point) Distance(q Point) float64 {
          return math.Hypot(q.X-p.X, q.Y-p.Y)
      }

      a := Point{1, 2}
      b := Point{4, 6}
      dist := a.Distance(b) // method call, dist is 5
    #+END_SRC
- The expression /object.methodName/ is called a /selector/, because it selects
  the appropriate /methodName/ method for the receiver of /object/.
  - Selectors are also used to select fields of struct types, hence methods and
    fields inhabit the same namespace, and declaring both with the same name is
    illegal.
- One benefit of using methods as opposed to function is that names for methods
  can generally be shorter.
*** 6.2 Methods with a Pointer Receiver
- For methods to update the recevier variable, we need to use pointers.
  - This is because calling a function (and methods are just functions attached
    to the receiver type) makes a copy of each argument value, including the
    receiver variable.
  - E.g.:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      func (p *Point) ScaleBy(factor float64) {
          p.X *= factor
          p.Y *= factor
      }
    #+END_SRC
  - The name of the method above is ~(*Point).ScaleBy~.
  - To avoid confusion, method declarations are not permitted on named types
    that are themselves pointer types:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      type P *int
      func (P) f() { /* ... */ } // compile error: invalid receiver type
    #+END_SRC
- In a realistec program, convention dictates that if any method of ~Point~
  (continuing with our example of far) has a pointer receiver, then all methods
  of ~Point~ should have a pointer receiver, even ones that don't strictly need
  it.
  - YJ's additional Googl-ing: The method set for types ~*T~ and ~T~ are
    different. In particular, methods of ~T~ are also methods of ~*T~ (i.e., Go
    will implicitly dereference the variable). The rationale is explained in the
    [[https://golang.org/doc/faq#different_method_sets][Go FAQs]].
- When calling method on type ~*T~ on a variable with type ~T~, Go compiler will
  perform an implicit ~&p~ on the variable.
- The three different cases of receiver variable type vs receiver parameter type
  are summarized as follows:
  | Variable Type     | Parameter Type   | Compiler Behavior                |
  |-------------------+------------------+----------------------------------|
  | Same as parameter | Same as variable | Calls the obvious method         |
  | ~T~               | ~*T~             | Implicitly obtains the address   |
  | ~*T~              | ~T~              | Implicitly deference the pointer |
- If all methods of a named type ~T~ have a recevier of type ~T~ itself (not
  ~*T~), it is safe to copy instance of that type, since calling any of its
  methods necessarily makes a copy.
  - If any method has apointer receiver, you should avoid copying instance of
    ~T~ because doing may violate internal invariants.
- ~nil~ is a valid recevier value.
  - When defining a type whose method allow ~nil~ as a receiver value, it's
    worth pointing this out explicitly in its documentation comment.
*** 6.3 Compasing Types by Struct Embedding
- Methods of an embedded anonymous field is promoted to the containing struct.
  - E.g.:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      import "image/color"
      type Point struct{ X, Y, float64 }
      type ColoredPoint struct {
          Point
          Color color.RGBA
      }
      func (p *Point) ScaleBy(factor int) { /* ... */ }

      var cp ColoredPoint
      cp.X = 1 // usual behavior of anonymous struct field
      cp.ScaleBy(2) // method of Point promoted to type ColoredPoint
    #+END_SRC
- The embedded field may be a pointer type, in which case fields and methods are
  promoted indirectly from the pointed-to object.
- When the compiler resolves a selector, it first looks for method declared
  directly on the type, then for methods promoted once from the embedded fields,
  then for methods promoted twice from the embedded fields of the embedded
  fields, and so on.
- One possible (and sometimes useful) use of embedded fields is to create
  unnamed types that have methods.
  - E.g.:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      var cache = struct {
          sync.Mutex
          mapping map[string]string
      } {
          mapping: make(map[string]string),
      }

      func Lookup(key string) string {
          cache.Lock()
          v := cache.mapping[key]
          cache.Unlock()
          return v
      }
    #+END_SRC
  - Recall that methods can only be declared on named types and pointer to named
    types. As such, unnamed types generally do not have methods.
*** 6.4 Method Values and Expressions
- The expression ~myInstance.MyMethod~ (notice the lack of parenthesis as
  compared to a usual method / function call), yields a /method value/---a
  function that binds a method (~MyMethod~ in our example) to a specific
  receiver (~myInstance~ in our example).
  - This useful when a package's API takes a function value, and the client's
    desired behavior when passing in the function value is for a method to be
    called on a specific receiver.
  - E.g., instead of the more verbose:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      type Rocket struct { /* ... */ }
      func (r *Rocket) Launch() { /* ... */ }

      r := new(Rocket)
      time.AfterFunc(10 * time.Second, func() { r.Launch() })
    #+END_SRC
    we can replace the last preceding line with this:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      time.AfterFunc(10 * time.Second, r.Launch)
    #+END_SRC
- A method expression, written ~T.f~ or ~(\*T).f~ where T is a type, yields a
  function value with a regular first parameter taking the place of the
  receiver.
  - E.g.:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      p := Point{1, 2}
      q := Point{4, 6}

      func (p Point) Distance(q Point) float64 { /* ... */ }

      distance := Point.Distance // method expression
      fmt.Println(distance(p, q))
      fmt.Printf("%T\n", distance) // "func(Point, Point) float64"
    #+END_SRC
*** 6.5 Example: Bit Vector Type
- Sets in Go are usually implemented as a ~map[T]bool~, where ~T~ is the element
  type.
- Beware of situations where the ~String()~ method is declared only with the
  pointer to named type as the receiver.
  - In such a situation, passing the named type itself (as opposed to a pointer)
    to functions like ~fmt.Println()~ will result in the default printing
    behavior as opposed to calling the ~String()~ declared on the pointer type.
*** 6.6 Encapsulation
- Go has only one mechanism to control the visibility of names: capitalized
  identifiers are exported from the package in which they are defined, and
  uncapitalized names are not.
  - This same mechanism limits access to fields of a struct or the methods of a
    type.
    - *As such, to encapsulate an object, we must make it a struct*. E.g.:
      #+BEGIN_SRC go
        type MyType struct {
            myField []uint64 // []uint64's methods inaccessible from MyType
        }

        type MyType2 []uint64 // []uint64's methods accessible from MyType 
      #+END_SRC
- On *encapsulation mechanism in Go*:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Another consequence of this name-based mechanism is that the unit of
    encapsulation is the package, not the type as in many other languages. The
    fields of a struct type are visible to all code within the same
    package. Whether the code appears in a function or method makes no
    difference.
  #+END_QUOTE
- In Go, when naming a getting method, the ~Get~ prefix is generally omitted.
  - This preference for brevity extends to all methods, and to other redundant
    prefixs such as ~Fetch~, ~Find~, and ~Lookup~>
  - Setters do retain the ~Set~ prefix.
** Chapter 7 - Interfaces
- On the purpose of interface types:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Interface types express generalizations or abstractions about the behaviors of
    other types. By generalizing, interfaces let us write functions that are more
    flexible and adaptable because they are not tied to the details of one
    particular implementation.
  #+END_QUOTE
- Go's interfaces are satisfied implicitly---i.e., duck-typing.
  - This allows creation of new interfaces that are satisfied by existing
    concrete types within changing the existing types.
*** 7.1 Interfaces as Contracts
- An /interface type/ doesn't expose the representation or internal structure of
  its value, or the set of basic operations they support; it reveals only some
  of their methods.
  - YJ: In this way, an /interface type/ acts as a limited contract on the
    behavior provided by the type satisfying the interface.
- Example of an interface (used by built-in functions like ~Fprintf()~):
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    package fmt
    
    type Stringer interface {
        String() string
    }
  #+END_SRC
- Interface enables substitutability.
*** 7.2 Interface Types
- New interface types may be declared as combinations of existing ones, using
  embedding. E.g.,
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    type ReadWriter interface {
        Reader
        Writer
    }

    type ReadWriteCloser interface {
        Reader
        Writer
        Closer
    }
  #+END_SRC
*** 7.3 Interface Satisfaction
- A type satisfies an interface if it possess all the methods the interface
  requires.
  - As a shorthand, Go programmers often say that a concrete type "is a"
    particular interface type, meaning it satisfies the interface.
- When determining whether type ~T~ satisfy a particular interface, the methods
  declared on type ~*T~ are not considered.
  - This is because although it is possible to call a method requiring a
    receiver with type ~*T~ with a variable of type ~T~ (i.e., letting the
    compiler implicitly take the address of the variable of type ~T~), this is
    mere syntactic sugar.
- The empty interface ~{}interface~ can be assigned any value.
- Since interface satisfaction depends only on the methods of the two types
  involved (the interface type and the concrete type), there is no need to
  declare the relationship between a concrete type and the interfaces it
  satisfies.
  - That said, it is occasionally useful to document and assert the relationship
    when it is intended but not otherwise enforced by the program. An example is
    as follows:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      // *bytes.Buffer must satisfy io.Writer
      var w io.Writer = new(bytes.Buffer)

      // a more frugal declaration that avoids allocation
      var _ io.Writer = (*bytes.Buffer)(nil)
    #+END_SRC
*** 7.5 Interface Values
- Conceptually, a value of an interface type, or /interface value/, has two
  components, a concrete type and a value of that type. These are called the
  interface's dynamic type and dynamic value.
  - The zero value of an interface type has both its type and value componentns
    set to ~nil~:
    #+BEGIN_SRC ditaa
             +-----+
       type  | nil |
             +-----+
      value  | nil |
             +-----+
    #+END_SRC
- If a value of type ~*os.File~ such as ~os.Stdout~ is assigned to the interface
  value of type ~io.Writer~, there will be an implicit conversion from a
  concrete type to an interface type, equivalent to the explicit conversion
  ~io.Writer(os.Stdout)~.
  - The interface value's dynamic type is set to the type descriptor for the
    pointer type ~*os.File~, and its dynamic value holds a /copy/ of
    ~os.Stdout~, which is a pointer to the ~os.File~ variable representing the
    standard output of the process.
    #+BEGIN_SRC ditaa
             +----------+
       type  | *os.File |      os.File
             +----------+      +-------------------+
      value  |     *----|----> | fd int=1 (stdout) |
             +----------+      +-------------------+
    #+END_SRC
  - Note: If the value being assigned to an interface value is not a pointer
    type, we can conceptually think that the value being assigned is held
    entirely within the dynamic value of the interface value, instead of needing
    a pointer. (Although a realistic implementation will be quite different.)
- In general, we cannot know at compile time what the dynamic type of an
  interface value will be, so a call through an interface must use dynamic
  dispatch.
  - Instead of a direct call, the compiler must generate code to obtain the
    address of the method being called from the type descriptor, then make an
    indirect call to that address. The receiver argument for the call is a copy
    of the interface's dynamic value.
- Assign ~nil~ to an interface value resets both its component to ~nil~.
- Interface values may be compared using ~==~ and ~!==~.
  - Two interface values are equal if both are ~nil~, or if their dynamic types
    are identical and their dynamic values are equal according to the usual
    behavior of ~==~ for that type.
  - Note however that while other types are either safely comparable or not
    comparable at all, comparison of interface types may result in panic.
    - The panic occurs when the two interface values haves the same dynamic
      type, but that type is not comparable.
- *An interface containing a ~nil~ pointer is non-nil*
  - E.g.:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
    	var a, b io.Writer
    	var buf *bytes.Buffer
    	a = nil
    	b = buf
    	fmt.Printf("Type of a: %T\n", a) // "Type of a: <nil>"
    	fmt.Printf("Type of b: %T\n", b) // "Type of b: *bytes.Buffer", non-nil
    #+END_SRC
  - Extra care needs to taken when passing a ~nil~ pointer to a function
    accepting an interface, and checking for ~nil~ within the function. This
    because the value will not be ~nil~ after crossing the function boundary due
    to the implicit copying and assignment to function argument.
*** 7.6 Sorting with ~sort.Interface~
- A sequence can be made sortable by defining three methods to satisfy
  ~sort.Interface~:
  - ~Len() int~
  - ~Less(i, j int) bool~
  - ~Swap(i, j int)~
*** 7.7 The ~http.Handler~ Interface
- An interesting example of type conversion of func to another func is as
  follows:
  - In ~http~ package, the ~ListenAndServe(...)~ function takes two arguments, a
    string representing the address to listen on, and an interface with the
    method ~ServeHttp(...)~.
  - For the second argument, the straightforward way is to pass in a type that
    has the ~ServeHttp(...)~ method defined, hence satisfying the required
    interface.
  - Alternatively, if we have a function object that matches the signature of
    ~ServeHttep(...)~ except for the receiver, we might /convert/ that function
    object into one that satisfy the required interface using
    ~HandlerFunc(ourOriginalFunc)~.
    - ~HandlerFunc()~ is defined in the ~http~ package as follows:
      #+BEGIN_SRC go
        package http

        type HandlerFunc func(w ResponseWriter, r *Request)
        func (f HandlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request) {
            f(w, r)
        }
      #+END_SRC
*** 7.8 The ~error~ Interface
- The ~error~ interface has a single method ~Error()~ that returns a ~string~.
- The simplest way to create an ~error~ is via ~errors.New()~.
*** 7.10 Type Assertions
- Type assertions take the form ~x.(T)~, where ~T~ is a type, called the
  "asserted" type.
- Type assertions may be performed with ~T~ being either a concrete type or
  interface type.
  - *Concrete Type*: If the asserted type ~T~ is a concrete type, the type
    assertion checks whether ~x~'s dynamic type is identical to ~T~ and if so,
    the result of the type assertion would be ~x~'s dynamic value. Otherwise, the
    assertion operation panics.
  - *Interface Type*: If the asserted type ~T~ is an interface type, the type
    assertion checks whether ~x~'s dynamic type satisfies ~T~ and if so, the
    result of the type assertion would still be an interface value with the same
    dynamic type and value components, but interface type of the result is now
    of interface type ~T~.
    - In other words, a type assertion to an interface type changes the type of
      the expression, making a different (and usually larger) set of methods
      accessible, but it preserves the dynamic type and value components inside
      the interface value.
- No matter what type is asserted, if the operand (i.e., the ~x~), is a ~nil~
  interface value (i.e., has ~nil~ dynamic type and value components), the type
  assertion fails.
- If the type assertion appears in an assignment in which two results are
  expected, the operation does not panic on failure but instead returns an
  additional second result, a boolean indicating success.
*** 7.11 Discriminating Errors with Type Assertions
- When handling errors, instead of checking for the presence or absence of a
  substring, represent the error values using a dedicated type, and check for
  type.
- When designing a package, in additional or as an alternative to exporting
  error types, consider exporting error distinguishing function that takes in an
  error as argument, and returns whether the error is of the particular type.
  - For example, in the code fragment below, the client code might be performing
    a file operation and is interested in all errors representing the situation
    that the file does not exist.

    Because different platforms handle I/O differently, there are several errors
    that correspond to this situation (in the example below, the errors might be
    ~syscall.ENOENT~, ~ErrNotExist~, or any of the previous two wrapped in
    ~PathError~).

    The ~IsNotExist()~ function below provides a standard way to check whether
    the error return from other functions in the package is due to a file not
    existing.
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      import (
          "errors"
          "syscall"
      )

      type PathError struct {
          Op string
          Path string
          Err error
      }
      func (e *PathError) Error() string { /* ... */ }

      var ErrNotExist = errors.New("file does not exist")

      func IsNotExist(err error) bool {
          if pe, ok := err.(*PathError); ok {
              err = pe.Err
          }
          return err == syscall.ENOENT || err == ErrNotExist
      }
    #+END_SRC
*** 7.12 Query Behaviors with Interface Type Assertions
- When interoperating between ~[]byte~ and ~string~, memory allocation will be
  needed for conversion between the two.
- Another way to achieve "polymorhpism" in Go is to have a function take an
  interface type, and in the function body, checks if the actual argument passed
  in satisfy a more restrictive interface.
  - If the argument does satisfy the more restrictive interface, the function
    will use the method on such interface.
  - If the argument does /not/ satisfy the more restrictive interface, the
    function will default to a method on the interface defined in the function
    parameter.
  - In the example below, ~writeString()~ will use the more efficient
    ~WriteString()~ method if available, and default to ~Write()~:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      func writeString(w io.Writer(w io.Writer, s string) (n int, err error) {
          type stringWriter interface {
              WriteString(string) (n int, err error)
          }
          if sw, ok := w.(stringWriter); ok {
              return sw.WriteString(s) // avoid a copy
          }
          return w.Write([]byte(s)) // allocate temporary copy
      }
    #+END_SRC
- In Go, defining a method of a particular type is taken as an implicit assent
  for a certain behavioral contract.
*** 7.13 Type Switches
- Interfaces are used in two distinct styles:
  1. An interface's methods express the similarities of the concrete types that
     satisfies the interface but hide the representation details and intrinsic
     operations of those concrete types. *The emphasis is on the methods, not on
     the concrete types.*
     - This is related to /subtype polymorhpism/ in traditional object-oriented
       programming.
  2. The second style exploits the ability of an interface value to hold values
     of a variety of concrete types and considers the interface to be the
     /union/ of those types. Type assertions are used to discriminate among
     these types dynamically and treat each case differently. In this style,
     *the emphasis is on the concrete types that satisfy the interface*, not on
     the interface methods (if it indeedd has any), and there is no hiding of
     information.
     - This is related to /ah hoc polymorhpism/ in traditional object-oriented
       programming.
     - YJ: The second approach relates to a concept called /sum types/ that is
       not available. See this article on [[https://making.pusher.com/alternatives-to-sum-types-in-go/][Alternatives to sum types in Go]] for
       details on what sum types are, and how it may be simulated in Go.
*** 7.15 A Few Words of Advice
- Salient Quote:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When designing a new package, novice Go programmers often start by creating a
set of interfaces and only later define the concrete types that satisfy
them. This approach results in many interfaces, each of which has only a single
implementation. Don't do that. Such interfaces are unnecessary abstractions;
they also have a run-time cost. ... Interfaces are only needed when there are
two or more concrete types that must be dealt with in a uniform way.
#+END_QUOTE
** Chapter 8 - Goroutines and Channels
- Go enables two styles of concurrent programming: communicating sequential
  processes (CSP) and shared memory multithreading.
*** 8.1 Goroutines
- In Go, each concurrently executing activity is called a goroutine.
- When a program starts, its only goroutine is the one that calls the ~main~
  function.
- New goroutines are created by the ~go~ statement, which is an ordinary
  function or method call prefixed by the keyword ~go~.
- When the main goroutine exits, all goroutines are abruptly terminated and the
  program exits.
  - Other than by returning from ~main~ or exiting the program, there is no
    programmatic way for one goroutine to stop another.
*** 8.2 Example: Concurrent Clock Server
- A simple example of a concurrent server loop might be as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC go
func main() {
    // ...

    for {
        conn, err : lister.Accept()
        if err != nil {
            log.Print(err) // e.g., connection aborted
            continue
        }
        go handleConn(conn) // handle connections concurrently
    }
}
#+END_SRC
*** 8.3 Example: Concurrent Echo Server
- The arguments to the function started by ~go~ are evaluated when the ~go~
  statement itself is executed.
*** 8.4 Channels
- Channels are created as follows:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    cd := make(chan int) // ch has type 'chan int'
  #+END_SRC
- A channel is a /reference/ to the data structure created by ~make~.
- The zero value of a channel, as with other reference types, is ~nil~.
- Two channels of the same type may be compared using ~==~, which returns ~true~
  only if both are references to the same channel data structure, or ~nil~.
- A channel has two principal operations: /send/ and /receive/, collectively
  known as communications.
  - Send: ~ch <- x~
  - Receive: ~x = <-ch~ or ~<-ch~ (the former assigns the result to a variable
    whereas the latter discards the result)
- A channel supports a third operation: /close/, i.e., ~close(ch)~.
  - This sets a flag indicating that no more values will ever be sent on this
    channel, and subsequent attempts to send will panic.
  - Receive operations on a closed channel yield the values that have been sent
    until no more values are left, and any recevie operations thereafter yields
    the zero value of the channel's element type.
- A channel may be buffered or unbuffered:
  - Unbuffered channels: ~ch = make(chan int)~ or ~ch = make(chan int, 0)~
  - Buffered channel: ~ch = make(chan int, 3)~ (buffered channel with capacity
    of 3)
**** 8.4.1 Unbuffered Channels
- A send operation on an unbuffered channel blocks the sending goroutine until
  another goroutine executes a corresponding receive on the same channel.
  - The converse is true for the receive operation.
- Communication over an unbuffered channel causes the sending and receiving
  goroutines to synchronize.
  - As such, unbuffered channels are sometimes called synchronous channels.
- Messages sent over channels have two important aspects:
  1. Value of the message
  2. The fact of the communication (i.e., synchronization-related)
     - When only the fact of the communication is important, it is common to use
       a channel whose element type is ~struct{}~, ~bool~ or ~int~.
**** 8.4.2 Pipelines
- Channels can be chained together to form pipelines. E.g.:
  - Function 1 might read or otherwise generate values and send it down channel
    A,
  - Function 2 might receive values from channel A, do further processing, and
    send it down channel B, and finally,
  - Function 3 might receive values from channel B, and output the values
    somewhere.
- There is no way to test directly whether a channel has been closed, but there
  is a variant of the receive operation that produces two results: the received
  channel element, plus a boolean value, conventionaly call ~ok~, which is
  ~true~ for a successful receive and ~false~ for a receive on a closed and
  drained channel.
  - E.g.:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      for {
          value, ok := <-theChan
          if !ok {
              break
          }
          // do something with value
      }
    #+END_SRC
  - A more convenient syntax is to loop over the channel itself, as follows:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      for value := range theChan {
         // do something with value
      }
    #+END_SRC
- There is no need to close every channel when done with it.
  - It is only necessary to close a channel when it is important to tell the
    receiving goroutines that all data have been sent.
  - A channel that the garbage collector determines to be unreachable will have
    its resources reclaimed whether or not it is closed.
**** 8.4.3 Unidirectional Channel Types
- When a channel is supplied as a function parameter, it is typical for the
  intent te be for the channel to be used exclusively for sending or exclusively
  for receiving.
  - To document this intent and prevent misuse, the Go type system provides
    unidirectional channel types that expose only one or the other end of the
    send and receive operations.
    - Send-only: ~func(ch chan<- theType)~
    - Receive-only: ~func(ch <-chan theType)~
  - Only the sending goroutine can call ~close~ on a unidirectional channel.
**** 8.4.4 Buffered Channels
- A buffered channels of capacity ~x~ allows sending of up to ~x~ values on the
  channel without the goroutine blocking.
- If the channel is neither full nor empty, either a send operation or a receive
  operation could proceed without blocking.
  - This way, the channel's buffer decouples the sending and receiving
    goroutines.
- A channel's buffer capacity may be obtained using the ~cap()~ function, though
  such need is usually unlikely.
- The ~len()~ function returns the number of elements currently buffered, though
  is a concurrent program this information is likely to be stale as soon as it
  is retrieved, and its value is limited.
- *If all you need is a simple queue, make one using a slice.*
  - Don't use channels because they are deeply connected to goroutine
    scheduling, and without another goroutine receiving from a channel, a
    sender---and perhaps the whole program---risks becoming blocked forever.
- A useful metaphor when reasoning about channels and goroutine is that of the
  assembly line:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Image three cooks in a cake shap, one baking, one icking, and one inscribing
each cake before passing it on to the next cook in the assembly line. In a
kitchen with litle space, each cook that has finished a cake must wait for the
next cook to become ready to accept it; this rendezvous is analogous to
communication over an unbuffered channel.

If there is space of one cake between each cook, a cook may place a finished
cake there and immediately start work on the next; this is analogous to a
buffered channel with capacity 1. So long as the cooks work at about the same
rate, on averega, most of these handovers proceed quickly, smoothing out
transient differences in their respective rates. More space between
cooks---larger buffers---can smooth out bigger transient variations in their
rates without stalling the assembly line, such as happens when one cook takes a
short break, then later rushes to catch up.

On the other hand, if an earlier stage of the assembly line is consistently
faster than the following stage, the buffer between them will spend most of its
time full. Conversely, if the later stage is faster, the buffer will ususally be
empty. A buffer provides no benefit in either case.

...

To solve the problem, we could hire another cook to help the [the slower step],
performing the same tasks but working independently. This is analogous to
creating another goroutine communicating over the same channels.
#+END_QUOTE
*** 8.5 Looping in Parallel
There are several different common ways of executing all the iterations of a
loop in parallel:
**** Known number of iterations; doesn't care about error or return value from each iteration
  - Simply adding a ~go~ keyword before the function representing the
    per-iteration processing.
  - If the containing function needs a way to wait until all the prcossing is
    done (e.g., if containing function is ~main~, and would otherwise exit
    before the other goroutines are done), this may be achieved by using the
    ~go~ statement on a literal function that does two things: call the
    original processing, and send a ~struct{}{}~ down a channel to indicate
    completion. The containing function can then loop through the same
    elements, and receive a value from the channel for each element.
  - E.g.:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
    func main() {
        ch := make(chan struct{})
        for _, val := range values {
            go func(v val) {
                process(v)
                ch <- struct{}{}
            }(v) // passing in v captured the variable 
        }
        for range values {
            <-ch // wait for completion by receiving once for each element of
                 //   values
        }
    }
    #+END_SRC
**** Known number of iterations; terminate on first error or return on first value received
- Use a buffered channel with capacity matching the number of iterations to
  avoid goroutine leaks.
- Alternatively, create another goroutine to drain the channel.
- E.g.:
#+BEGIN_SRC go
func processItems(raws []item) (processeds []item, err error) {
    type msg struct {
        it item
        err error
    }
    ch := make(chan msg, len(raw))

    for _, raw := range raws {
        go func(raw item) {
            var m msg
            m.it, m.err = processItem(raw)
            ch <- m
    }(raw)

    for range raws {
        m := <-ch
        if m.err != nil {
            return nil, it.err
        }
        processeds = append(processeds, m.it)
    }

    return processeds, nil
}
#+END_SRC
**** Unknown number of iterations; interested in per-iteration return values
- Use a ~sync.WaitGroup~:
  - Before entering the loop, create a ~sync.WaitGroup~ (e.g., ~var wg
    sync.WaitGroup~).
  - Before each ~go~ statement creating a goroutine to process an iteration,
    call ~wg.Add(1)~.
  - Within each goroutine processing an iteration, call ~wg.Done()~ when
    processing is done (this is usually achieved via a ~defer wg.Done()~).
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      func main() {

          // create channel, WaitGroup, obtain items to be processed...
          
          for it := range items {
              wg.Add(1)
              go func(it item) {
                  defer wg.Done()
                  // actual processing...
                  ch <- results
              }(it)
          }
          
          // handle waiting for goroutines started in loop above...
      }
    #+END_SRC
  - After the loop, start a "closer" goroutine:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      func main() {
    
          // loop that starts goroutines for each iteration...
    
          go func() {
              wg.Wait()
              close(ch)
          }()
    
          // all goroutines started by the loop has finished at this point...
      }
    #+END_SRC
    Note: The "closer" goroutine needs to be in a seperate goroutine such that
    the ~main~ function can contiue, and start receiving frorm the
    ~ch~. Otherwise, the earlier goroutines started in the loop will block when
    trying to send down ~ch~, and ~wg.Wait()~ will never return.
  - Finally, the channel may be looped over normally, since it will be closed by
    the closer goroutine when goroutines for all iterations are done.
*** 8.6 Example: Concurrent Web Crawler
- A buffered channel can be used as a counting semaphore by having each
  goroutine "acquire" the semaphore by sending on the channel and "release" by
  receiving from the channel.
  - The channel element is usually of type ~struct{}~.
- When a channel is used as a task queue that may be continuously populated as
  tasks are being processed, a way to ensure termination (instead of blocking on
  the receive when tasks run out) is to use a traditional ~for~ loop instead of
  the ~range~ loop over the channel.
  - The ~for~ loop counter is initialized to the initial number of tasks on the
    queue.
  - The loop counter is decremented by one for each iteration of the loop which
    receives a task from the channel processes it.
  - The loop counter is incremented each time a task is sent to the task
    channel.
- An alternative to using counting semaphore is to create ~x~ number of
  goroutines that will continuously receive from the task queue.
  - Additional tasks generated during the processing of tasks may be added
    directly to the tasks queue, or to a separate channel in the case of
    multi-step processing.
  - Goroutine termination must also be properly handled.
*** 8.7 Multiplexing with ~select~
- The ~time.Tick()~ function returns a channel that returns a channel on which
  it sends events periodically, acting as a metronome.
  - The value of each event is the timestamp.
  - The ~time.Tick()~ function behaves as if it creates a goroutine that calls
    ~time.Sleep~ in a loop, sending an event each time it wakes up.
  - The ~time.Tick()~ function is only appropriate when the ticks is required
    throughout the lifetime of the application. Otherwise it would result in a
    goroutine leak.
  - The alternative is to use the following:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      ticker := time.NewTicker(1 * time.Second)
      <- ticker.C // receive from the ticker's channel
      ticker.Stop() // cause the ticker's goroutine to stop
    #+END_SRC
- The ~select~ statement is used to multiplex operations, e.g.:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    select {
    case <-ch1:
        // ...
    case x := <-ch2:
        // ...
    case ch3 <- y:
        // ...
    default:
        // ...
    }
  #+END_SRC
- The ~select~ statement waits until a communication (i.e., a send or receive on
  a channel)for any case is ready to proceed, it then performs the communication
  and executes the case's associated statements.
  - If multiple cases are ready, ~select~ picks one at random, which ensures
    that every case has an equal chance of being selected.
- A ~select~ statement may be used to poll a channel until it is ready to
  communicate.
  - This is achieved by having a ~default~ case that does nothing, and looping
    over the ~select~ statement.
- Send or receive operations on a ~nil~ channel blocks forever.
  - As such, ~nil~ values may be used to disable cases on a ~select~ statement.
*** 8.8 Example: Concurrent Directory Traversal
*** 8.9 Cancellation
- To reliably cancel an arbitrary number of goroutines, we need a reliable
  mechanism to broadcast an event over a channel so that many goroutines can see
  it as it occurs and later see that it has occurred..
- A channel can be used as a broadcast mechanism: by closing it instead of
  sending values.
- Cancellation of goroutines using channels general require three different
  components:
  1. A utility function to poll the cancellation state, an example is as follows:
     #+BEGIN_SRC go
       var done = make(chan struct{})
     
       func cancelled() bool {
           select {
           case <- done:
               return true
           case default:
               return false
           }
       }
     #+END_SRC
  2. A goroutine to watch for the cancellation condition, and close the
     cancellation channel when the condition is met. An example (where the
     cancellation condition is any byte received from the standard input) is as
     follows:
     #+BEGIN_SRC go
       go func() {
           os.stdin.Read(make([]byte, 1)) // read a single byte
           close(done) // done is the cancellation channel, following on from
                       //   the previous example.
       }
     #+END_SRC
  3. Finally, the various goroutines that may be cancelled need to check for the
     cancellation state at appropriate points in each of their processing.
     - E.g., to transform a goroutine that currently iterates over a channel
       using ~range~ into one that responds to cancellation, we can multiplex a
       cancellation check with the receive communication on the work channel, as
       follows:
       #+BEGIN_SRC go
         for {
             select {
             case x, ok := <-work:
                 // Do work...
       
             case <- done:
                 // Drain work channel to allow existing goroutines to finish.
                 for range work:
                     // Do nothing.
                 return // Or break.
             }
         }

     - Other places to check for cancellation state (and terminating early if
       cancelled) include:
       - At the beginning of a goroutine.
       - Multiplexed with acquisition of a counting semaphore.
       - Right before spawning another goroutine with the ~go~ statement.
*** 8.10 Example: Chat Server
** Chapter 9 - Concurrency with Shared Variables
*** 9.1 Race Conditions
- A function is concurrency-safe if it continues to work correctly even when
  called concurrently---i.e., from two or more goroutines without additional
  synchronization.
- A type is concurrency-safe if all its accessible methods and operations are
  concurrency-safe.
- Generally, concurrency-safe /types/ are the exception rather than the rule,
  and we avoid accessing them concurrently.
  - Concurrent access can be avoid by (a) confining the variable to a single
    goroutine, or (b) using a higher-level invariant of mutual exclusion.
- On the other hand, exported package-level functions are generally expected to
  be concurrency-safe.
  - This is because package-level variables cannot be confined to a single
    goroutine, functions that modify them must enforce mutual exclusion. 
- One particular kind of race condition is called the /data race/---where two
  goroutines access the same variable concurrently and at least one of the
  access is write.
  - Ways to avoid data race includes:
    1. Avoid writes where possible, by initializing the data structure prior to
       concurrent access.
    2. Confining the variable to a single goroutine (called the /monitor
       goroutine/), and where other goroutines need to query or update the
       variable, they send a monitor goroutine a request via a channel.
       - This is what is meant by the Go mantra "/Do not communicate by sharing
         memory; instead, share memory by communicating./"
    3. Use mutual exclusion (next chapter).
*** 9.2 Mutual Exclusion: ~sync.Mutex~
- A counting semaphore of that counts only to 1 is also called a binary semaphore.
- Using a binary semaphore to protect a resource ensure mutually exclusive
  access to that resource.
- The ~sync~ package provides the ~Mutex~ type with ~Lock()~ and ~Unlock()~
  methods to acquire and release the lock.
  - E.g.:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      import "sync"

      var (
          mu sync.Mutex
          balance int
      )

      func Deposit(amount int) {
          mu.Lock()
          balance = balance + amount
          mu.Unlock()
      }

      func Balance() int {
          mu.Lock()
          b := balance
          mu.Unlock()
          return b
      }

      // Alternative implementation of Balance()
      func Balance() int {
          mu.Lock()
          defer mu.Unlock()
          return balance
      }
    #+END_SRC
- By convention, the variables guarded by a mutex are declared immediately after
  the declaration of the mutex itself.
- The region of code between ~Lock()~ and ~Unlock()~ in which a goroutine is
  free to read and modify the shared variables is called a critical section.
- A common concurrency pattern is for a set of exported functions to encapsulate
  one or more variables so that the onl yway to access the variables is through
  these functions (recall that methods are really just functions with a receiver).
  - Each function acquires a mutex at the beginning and releases it at the end.
  - This arrangement of functions, mutex lock, and variables is called a
    /monitor/.
- ~sync.Mutex~ is *not re-entrant*, i.e., a goroutine that has already acquired
  the lock cannot require the lock.
  - For example, the following function will not work:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      func Withdraw(amount int) bool {
          mu.Lock()
          defer mu.Unlock()
          Deposit(-amount)
          if Balance() < 0 {
              Deposit(amount)
              return false // insufficient funds
          }
          return true
      }
    #+END_SRC
  - The reason Go's mutex lock is not re-entrant is because the purpose of a
    mutex is to ensure certain invariants of share variables are maintained at
    critical points of a program.
    - When a goroutine acquires a mutex lock, it may assume that all these
      invariants hold; when a goroutine releases the lock, it must guarantee
      that order has been restored and the invariants once again hold.
    - A re-entrant mutex would only ensure the invariant that no other
      goroutines are accessing the shared variables, it does not ensure other
      invariants.
- A way around Go's mutex not being re-entrant is to split the functions into
  two: an unexported function that assumes the lock is already held and does the
  real work, and an exported function that acquires that lock before calling the
  first function.
*** 9.3 Read/Write Mutexes: ~sync.RWMutex~
- A /multiple reader, single writer/ lock allows read operations to proceed
  parallel with each other as long as there is no write operation in
  parallel. Write operations require fully exclusive access.
- In Go, such a lock is provided in ~sync.RWMutex~.
  - An example usage is as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC go
  var mu sync.RWMutex
  var balance int

  func Balance() int {
      mu.RLock() // readers lock
      defer mu.RUnlock()
      return balance
  }
#+END_SRC
*** 9.4 Memory Synchronization
- Often times, read operations would require synchronization to prevent reading
  of stale values that have been cached in the processor.
- Relevant quote:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In a modern computer there may be dozens of processors, each with its own local
  cache of the main memory. For efficiency, writes to memory are buffered within
  each processor and flushed out to the main memory only when necessary.
  
  ...
  
  Within a goroutine, the effects of each statement are guaranteed to occur in the
  order of execution; goroutines are sequentially consistent. But in the absence
  of explicit synchronization using a channel or mutex, there is no guarantee that
  events are seen in the same order by all goroutines.

  ... (Next section)

  In the absence of explicit synchronization, the compiler and CPU are free to
  reorder memory access in any number of ways, so long as the behavior for each
  goroutine is sequentially consistent.
  #+END_QUOTE
- For example, consider the following snippet of code:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    var x, y int
    go func() {
        x = x + 1
        fmt.Print("y:", y, " ")
    }()
    go func() {
        y = y + 1
        fmt.Print("x:", x, " ")
    }
  #+END_SRC
  one might think the only possible outputs are:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    y: 0 x: 1
    x: 0 y: 1
    y: 1 x: 1  // Where the bottom goroutine executes after the first statement
               // in the top goroutine has executed.
    x: 1 y: 1  // Where the top goroutine executes after the first statement in
               // the bottom has executed.
  #+END_SRC
  however, the following are also possible (i.e., each goroutine prints a stale
  value of the variable it didn't increment):
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    y: 0 x: 0
    x: 0 y: 0
  #+END_SRC
*** 9.5 Lazy Initialization: ~sync.Once~
- The problem of lazy initialization in a concurrent application, simply put, is
  as follows:
  1. We want to defer initialization to the last possible moment to avoid wasted
     computation.
  2. Option A: Do it without synchronization, and assume that the worst possible
     that could happen is that two or more goroutines concurrenty initializes
     the variable.
     - Problem: The assumption is wrong because while the first goroutine is
       halfway through initializing the variable, a second goroutine might
       already see the variable as initialized, and proceed to use it.
  3. Option B: Add a simple mutex.
     - Problem: This forces the variable to be accessed exclusively even after
       initialization.
  4. Option C: Use a ~sync.RWMutex~.
     - E.g.:
       #+BEGIN_SRC go
         var mu sync.RWMutex
         var theVariable MyVariableType
       
         // Concurrency-safe.
         func TheVariable() someValueType {
             mu.RLock()
             if theVariable != nil {
                 v := theVariable.GimmeThyValue()
                 mu.RLock()
                 return v
             }
             mu.RLock()
       
             // Acquire an exclusive lock.
             mu.Lock()
             if theVariable != nil {
                 initTheVariable()
             }
             v := theVariable.Gimmethyvalue()
             mu.Unlock()
             return v
         }
       #+END_SRC
     - Problem: Code becomes complicated and error-prone. And there are now two
       critical sections.
  5. Option D (Solution): Use ~sync.Once~'s ~Do()~ method.
     - Conceptually, ~sync.Once~ comprises a mutex and a boolean variable
       recording whether the initialization has taken place. The mutex guards
       both the mutex and the client data structure.
     - E.g.:
       #+BEGIN_SRC go
         var initOnce sync.Once
         var theVariable MyVariableType
       
         // Concurrency-safe.
         func TheVariable() someValueType {
             initOnce.Do(initTheVariable)
             return theVariable.Gimmethyvalue()
         }
       #+END_SRC
*** 9.6 Race Detector
- Go runtime and toolchain provides a /race detector/ dynamic analysis tool.
- By adding the ~-race~ flag to commands like ~go build~, ~go run~ and ~go
  test~, the compiler will build a modified version of the application or test
  with additional instrumentation.
  - The additional instrumentation will effectively record all access to shared
    variables that occurred during execution, along with the goroutine that read
    or wrote the variable.
  - The instrumentation also records all sychronization events: ~go~ statements,
    channel operations, and calls to ~(\*sync.Mutex).Lock~,
    ~(\*sync.WaitGroup).Wait~ etc.
- The race detector will use the additional information provided by
  instrumentation to detect situations where one goroutine read or write to a
  variable that was most recently modified by another goroutine without in
  intervening synchronization event.
  - This indicates a data race.
  - However, the race detector can only detect data races that actually occurred
    during a particular run.
*** 9.7 Example: Concurrent Non-Blocking Cache
*** 9.8 Goroutines and Threads
- Go's stack has growable sizes. They start small (around 2KB) and can grow (up
  to around 1GB).
- Go runtime has its own scheduler and uses a technique known as /m:n scheduling/.
  - Unlike an OS thread which is managed by the kernel and requires a full
    context switch
  - Go's scheduler is also no invoked periodically by a hardware timer, instead,
    it is triggered implicitly by Go's language construct.
- The ~GOMAXPROCS~ parameter of the Go scheduler determines how many OS threads
  may be actively executing Go code simultaneously.
- Goroutines have no notion of identity that is accessible to the programmer.
  - This is by design, and prevents use of "thread-local" storage by
    programmers.
** Chapter 10 - Packages and the Go Tool
*** 10.1 Introduction
- Packages provide encapsulation by controlling which names are visible or
  exported outside the package.
*** 10.5 Blank Imports
- It is an error to import a package into a file but not refer to the names it
  defines within the file.
- However, on occasion we import a package merely for the side effects of doing
  so: evaluation of the initializer expressions of its package-level variables
  and its ~init~ function.
  - This may be done by using a renaming import in which the alternative name is
    ~_~, the blank identifier.
  - E.g., importing ~"image/png"~ to register the ability to decode PNG files
    using ~image.Decode()~. This works because ~image~ package has a
    ~image.RegisterFormat()~ function which is called in the ~init()~ function
    of ~"image/png"~.
*** 10.6 Packages and Naming
- When creating a package, keep its name short, but not so short as to be cryptic.
*** 10.7 The Go Tool
- The directories that ~go get~ creates are true clients of the remote
  repositories, not just copies of the files.
  - E.g., it is possible to run ~git remote -v~ within the folder to see the
    remote paths (assuming the source code is version controlled using Git).
- Building packages:
  - Since each directory contains one package, each executable program requires
    its own directory. These directories are sometimes children of a directory
    named =cmd=, such as =golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc=.
  - Packages may be specified by their import paths, or by a relative directory
    name, which must start with ~.~ or ~..~.
  - ~go install~ is similar to ~go build~, except that it saves the compiled
    code and command instead of throwing it away.
- Documenting packages:
  - The ~go doc~ tool prints the declaration and ~doc~ comment of the entity
    specified on the command line, which may be a package, a package member, or
    a method.
  - The ~godoc~ tool serves cross-linked HTML pages that provide the same
    information as ~go doc~ and much more.
- Internal packages:
  - The ~go build~ tool treats a package specially if its import path contains a
    path segment name ~internal~.
  - Such packages are called /internal packages/.
  - An internal package may be imported only by another package that is inside
    the tree rooted at the parent of the ~internal~ directory.
  - E.g., given the packages below, ~net/http/internal/chunked~ can be imported
    from ~net/http/httputil~ or ~net/http~, but not from ~net/url~. However,
    ~net/url~ may import ~net/http/httputil~:
    #+BEGIN_SRC go
      net/http
      net/http/internal/chunked
      net/http/httputil
      net/url
    #+END_SRC
- Query packages:
  - The ~go list~ tool reports information about available packages.
  - In its simplest form, ~go list~ test whether a package is present in the
    workspace and prints its import path if so.
  - An argument to ~go list~ may contain the "..." wildcard, which matches any
    substring of a package's import path.
    - We can use it to enumerate all the packages within a Go workspace: ~go
      list ...~; within a specific subtree: ~go list gopl.io/ch3/...~; or
      related to a particular topic: ~go list ...xml...~.
** Chapter 11 - Testing
*** 11.1 The ~go test~ Tool
- In a package directory, files whose names end with ~_test.go~ are not part of
  the package normally built by ~go build~, but are built by ~go test~.
- ~*_test.go~ files treat three kinds of functions specially: tests, benchmarks,
  and examples.
  - A test function begins with ~Test~
  - A benchmark function begins with ~Benchmark~
  - An example function begins with ~Example~, provides machine-checked
    documentation.
*** 11.2 Test Functions
- Each test file must import the ~testing~ package.
- Test functions have the following signature:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    func TestName(t *testing.T) {
        // ...
    }
  #+END_SRC
- The ~-v~ flag prints the name and execution time of each test in the package.
- The ~-run~ flag takes a regular expression and causes ~go test~ to run only
  those tests whose function name matches the pattern.
- It is common to use table-driven tests in Go.
- Test failure messages are usually of the form "f(x) = y, want z".
- It is possible to test the ~main~ package by having a test file in the same
  package. The ~go test~ command will ignore the ~main()~ function of the
  package and run the test functions.
- White-box testing vs black-box testing:
  - One way of categorizing tests is by the level of knowledge they require of
    the internal workings of the package under test.
  - *Black-box*: assumes nothing about the package other than what is exposed by
    the APIs.
  - *White-box*: has privileged access to the internal functions and data
    structures of the package and can make observations and changes that an
    ordinary client cannot.
  - The two approaches are complementary
- Mocking in Go maybe done using global variables.
  - I.e., the function under test relies on certain global variables, and the
    test code replaces the global variables with the necessary stubs before
    executing the function under test, and uses ~defer~ to restore the global
    variables as necessary for subsequent tests.
- External test packages
  - Sometimes testing a lower-level package requires importing a higher-level
    package, which already depends on the lower-level package. This results in a
    cycle. E.g., ~net/http~ depends on the lower-level ~net/url~, but testing of
    ~net/url~ includes examples that requires importing ~net/http~.
  - To solve this issue, it is possible to create an /external test package/
    within the package directory of ~net/url~ with an additional ~_test~ suffix
    to the package declaration.
    - Sometimes an external test package requires privileged access to the
      internals of the package under test. In such situations, an in-package
      ~<name>_test.go~ file is used to expose the necessary internals by
      assigning such internals to exported symbols.
*** 11.3 Coverage
- The ~cover~ tool provides information about test coverage.
- Information about the ~cover~ tool may be printed using: ~go tool cover~.
- The cover tool may be runned as follows:
  - Run the tests, creating the coverage profile: ~go test -coverprofile=c.out~.
  - Generate HTML report and open in browser: ~go tool cover -html=c.out~.
- For just a summary, the test command may be runned as follows: ~go test
  -cover~.
*** 11.4 Benchmark Functions
- A benchmark function might look something like the following:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    import "testing"
  
    func BenchmarkIsPalindrome(b *testing.B) {
        for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
            isPalindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")
        }
    }
  #+END_SRC
- Benchmark might be run a the command: ~go test -bench=.~.
  - The ~.~ pattern causes all benchmark functions to be matched.
- Generally, the fastest program is often the one that makes the fewest memory
  allocations.
  - The ~go test -bench=. -benchmem~ command will include memory allocation
    statistics in its report.
- Comparative benchmarks may take the form below. ~benchmark~ function the is
  not executed directly by the benchmark tool, but is invoked repeated by the
  ~Benchmark*~ functions.
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    func benchmark(b *testing.B, size int) {/* ... */}
    func Benchmark10(b *testing.B, size int) { benchmark(b, 10) }
    func Benchmark100(b *testing.B, size int) { benchmark(b, 100) }
    func Benchmark1000(b *testing.B, size int) { benchmark(b, 10000) }
  #+END_SRC
*** 11.5 Profiling
- Go supports different kinds of profiling:
  - *CPU profile*: Identifies the functions whose execution requires the most CPU
    time.
    - The currently running thread on each CPU is interrupted periodically by
      the operating system every few milliseconds, with each interruption
      recording one profile event before normal execution resumes.
  - *Heap profile*: Identifies the statements responsible for allocating the most
    memory.
    - The profiling library samples calls to the internal memory allocation
      routines so thet on average, one profile event is recorded per 512KB of
      allocated memory.
  - *Blocking profile*: Identifies the operations responsible for blocking
    goroutines the longest, such as system calls, channel sends and receives,
    and acquisition of locks.
    - The profiling library records an event every time a goroutine is blocked
      by one of these operations.
- Profiles might be generated as follows:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
    go test -cpuprofile=cpu.out
    go test -memprofile=mem.out
    go test -blockprofile=block.out
  #+END_SRC
  - Be careful when using more than one flag at a time as the machinery for
    gathering one kind of profile may skew the results of others.
- Adding profiling support to non-test programs:
  - *Short-live command-line tools*
  - *Long-running server applications*: Go runtime's profiling features can be
    enabled under programmer control using the =runtime API=.
  - The profile is analyzed using the pprof tool, accessed via ~go tool pprof~.
*** 11.6 Example Functions
- An example function might look something like the following:
  #+BEGIN_SRC go
  func ExampleIsPalindrome() {
      fmt.Println(IsPalindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"))
      fmt.Println(IsPalindrome("palindrome"))
      // Output:
      // true
      // false
  }
  #+END_SRC
  - Notice that the function has no parameter, and contains comment starting
    with ~// Output:~.
- Example functions serve three purposes:
  1. *Documentation*: A good example can be a more succint or intuitive way to
     convey the behavior of a library function than its prose description,
     especially when used as a reminder or quick reference.
     - Based on the suffix of the example function, the web-based documentation
       server ~godoc~ associates example functions with the function or package
       they exemplify. An example function just called ~Example~ would be
       associated with the package as a whole.
  2. *Executable Tests*: Example functions are executable tests run by ~go
     test~. If the example function contains a final ~// Output:~ comment, the
     test driver will execute the function adn check that what it printed to its
     standard output matches the text within the comment.
  3. *Hands-On Experimentation*: The ~godoc~ server at =golang.org= uses the Go
     Playground to let the user edit and run each example function from within a
     browser. This is often the fastest way to get a feel for a particular
     function or language feature.

- Refer to this section for an example of building a concurrent non-blocking
  cache step-by-step:
  - Starting from a non-concurrent cache and using it serially
  - Attempting to use the non-concurrent cache in a parallel fashion
  - Debugging the ensuing data race using the race detector
  - Adding synchronization but accidentally removing the parallelization
  - Modifying the synchronization (into two critical section, one for read and
    one for write) to make the application parallel again
  - Implementing /duplicate suppression/ using a broadcast channel associated
    with each cached item.
- The section also contrast the above implementation---which is based on shared
  variables---with one based on communicating sequential processes.
** Chapter 11
*** 11.2 Test Functions
- Refer to this section for an example of table-driven test.
- The section also provides a simple example of randomized tests.
*** 11.2.5 Writing Effective Go Tests
- Refor to this section on Go's testing philosophy:
  - Lack of standard set-up and tear-down methods
  - Lack of standard comparison functions
  - Etc.
