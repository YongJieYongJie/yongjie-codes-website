* General Review
- This is an in-depth article explaining the use of log as the medium for data
  transfer / message brokering in a distributed system.
  - The specific system is Kafka.
  - In particular, the article discusses the problems faced by LinkedIn prior to
    Kafka, and how Kafka enabled centralize communications across different
    services producing and consuming data/messages.
- The article also contains numerous references to various other similar and
  related technologies.
* Specific Takeaways
- The log is a useful abstraction for centralize data management across multiple
  producers and consumers of data.
- When designing new systems, consider using a centralized log for all data, and
  keep any new sources of data centralized.
* To Internalize /Now/
- Nil
* To Learn/Do Soon
- More about Kafka, and how it may be useful
- Pick up a book on Kafka.
- Read up on RabbitMq.
- Distributed systems
* To Revisit When Necessary
- How various opensource technologies fit together (or overlap) in the whole
  data pipeline / system:
  - Zookeeper, Helix, Curator, Mesos, YARN, Lucene, LevelDB, Netty, Jetty,
    Finagle, rest.li, Avro, Protocol Buffers, Thrift, Kafka, Bookeeper
- Comprehensive list of references (academic papers, systems, talks and blogs)
  on:
  - stream processing
  - distributed systems
- What are the similar problems faced in enterprise software engineering,
  including:
  - Event Sourcing
  - Change Data Capture
  - Complex Event Processing (CEP)
  - Enterprise Service Bus
