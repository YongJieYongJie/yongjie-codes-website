* General Review
- Read this book if you want to learn how to use Vim/Neovim more like an IDE.
- The book explains how to configure and use various plugins to provide IDE-like
  features to Vim.
* Specific Takeaways
- You should try out "non-official" forks of open-source software that interests you.
  - By exploring and supporting such "non-official" forks, the software actually
    develops more.
  - For example, Neovim is one such worthy project to check out (apparently the
    story is that the original creator of Neovim submitted a pull request adding
    asynchronous operations support to Vim, but was rejected)
* To Internalize /Now/
- The [[https://vimhelp.org/quickfix.txt.html][quickfix]] list is global across buffers, whereas the location list is a
  window-local quickfix list
- To generate help tags after installing plugins, run ~:helptags ALL~
- To scroll up and down without moving the cursor, use =<C-e>= and
  =<C-y>=
- To execute a command in shell and read the output back into Vim, use
  ~:read !<cmd>~
- Use more of =<Leader>X= key for commonly used commands
- Use =<C-^>= to switch to alternate-file
- Use =<C-x>= to decrement number and =<C-a>= to increment number
- Use ~expand()~ to expand variables. E.g., ~:echo expand("%")~
* To Learn Soon
- Look through all the normal mode commands starting with ~g~ (~:help g~)
- Revise how to properly use Vim's in-built help system (~:help help~)
* To Revisit When Necessary
- How to install plugins using Vim's new in-built package manager
- How to configure quick alternate files jumping (e.g., header and
  source; source and unit tests) using [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist][vim-projectionist]] plugin
- How to configure Vim to run compiler / linting / tests
- How to configure Vim for a better file searching experience
- How to use terminal in Neovim
- How to use [[https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote][neovim-remote]] to avoid multiple instances of Neovim
- How to configure Vim to run certain commands asynchronously; use Vim job control
