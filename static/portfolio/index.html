                        <p>Parties to many divorce proceedings unnecessarily
                            choose litigation instead of settling even when a
                            compromise is possible.</p>

                        <p>Underlying reason: In divorce proceedings,
                            relationships tend to be acrimonious, and parties
                            will subjectively believe they deserve a greater
                            share of the asset then they actually do.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>Lead-on consequences: (1) The parties themselves
                            incur more time and money when embroiled in legal
                            proceedings they unnecessarily received legal
                            services, and (2) the society suffers loss as the
                            judiciary system is unecessarily burdened by such
                            cases.</p>

                                (it is akin to having a neutral third party
                                providing the prediction)</li>

                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>Target users of the outcome simulator are lawyers and
                            not the parties to the divorce themselves.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This is because parties would need to engage the
                            lawyers in any case and it would make little sense
                            for parties to learn a new platform for a divorce
                            proceeding which doesn't happen more than a few
                            times at most.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>The prediction report shows only the information that
                            are directly relevant to the particular case.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This is because early prototypes which contained
                            charts and showed the data in various alternative
                            scenarios proved a little to complicated for
                            lawyers.</p>

                            <li>The frontend is built as a SPA using React to
                                ensure a smooth experience and to allow for
                                design of user-friendly input components (since
                                the application requires complicated data
                                entry).</li>
                            <li>The backend is built on Django in order to
                                interface smoothly with the data pipeline and
                                prediction models that are written in
                                Python.</li>

                        <p>Lawyers spend unnecessarily time reinventing the
                            wheel when developing their own document version
                            control systems based on whichever office suite of
                            technologies their firms are using.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>Underlying reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is no industry standard tool (unlike GIT
                                for software engineers). And existing
                                proprietory tools are not cheap.</li>
                            <li>There is a lack of incentive of develop
                                efficient tool because legal services are
                                usually charged by the hour. Furthermore lawyers
                                lack the technical expertise to develop such
                                tools personally.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <section>
                        <p>Lead-on Consequences:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The lack of proper document organization systems
                                adds to the cognitive load and burden of all
                                lawyers, especially younger lawyers who has yet
                                to develop a system of management for
                                themselves. This leads to lower career
                                satisfaction and high attrition rate among
                                lawyers.</li>
                            <li>Clients bear extra legal cost due to inefficiencies
                                regarding different system used by different law
                                firms, and very often, even different lawyers in
                                the same firm.</li>
